  <h1 class="w3-large">End to end encryption on our Server- Explained like you're 5</h1>
<p>Imagine a box. A box in which you put all your photos.</p><p>For safekeeping you give the box to a cloud storage service. But then, some nosy
employees start peeking into the box.</p><p>Meanwhile, the cloud service company is training an AI, and for training their
AI they need lots of data. So they cannot resist, and open the box so that they
can train their AI on all the photos inside the box.</p><p>By now, the government also wants to join-in on the snooping, and demands (and
gets) access to the box.</p><p>All this, when you are already paying the cloud service for storing your data!</p><p>While one can still excuse the company for nosy employees and governments as
factors that are hard to control, or are under external control, it is unethical
of them to systematically use your photos for training their own systems.
Inspite of you paying them to store your data, they're essentially treating the
photos as their own property.</p><p>With advancements in AI, this has become their real business model. At the
cutting edge, all companies have access to the similar algorithms for their AI,
and also have vast computing power at their disposal - so the differentiating
factor between mediocre and scintillating AI is at the amount of data needed to
train it.</p><p>Indeed, data is the new oil.</p><p>All this makes many of us uncomfortable. We don’t want people to peek into our
photos. Even worse, AI models, which will never forget, remembering our private
memories.</p><p>Is this the new unavoidable reality?</p><p>Luckily, there is a solution to this. End to end encryption.</p><p>Encryption is a mathematical way of locking a box of data so that it cannot be
opened without the key. These companies already use encryption when they’re
transferring your box of photos over the internet. But the key is with them, and
so they can, and do, open the box as they wish.</p><p>With end to end encryption, also known as E2EE, you lock the box, and the key is
with you. This is what "end to end" means. The key is with you.</p><p>The box is locked at your "end". The locked box is given to the E2EE service for
storage. And when you want to see your photos again, maybe on a different
device, you download the box again and open it on your "end".</p><p>This solves all the problems. No one in the middle can peek. Nosy employees,
overbearing governments, or greedy companies - none of them can see your data,
even if they want.</p><p>Of course, end-to-end encryption has some problems if its own. The biggest of
these is that if you lose your key, the cloud storage service cannot help you
recover your data - nobody can unlock the box without the key, so if the key is
lost, then the box cannot be unlocked.</p><p>Another smaller problem is that locking and unlocking the data on your device
itself requires your device to do a bit more work, especially for searching your
photos. Previously many things were easy since they could be done on the server,
which is not possible in an end to end encrypted service since the server can’t
see the photos, so all this needs to be done on your device.</p><p>The good news is that newer phones nowadays have dedicated chips for
specifically doing these searching and indexing locally. These chips make doing
all these operations fast and battery efficient. So this problem is already on
its way out.</p><p>Work still needs to be done to reduce the risk of losing the key. One way to do
this is by introducing "social" recovery, where alternative 2-of-3 keys that can
be distributed amongst your friends. The mathematics and technology for doing
that is there, it does need wider adoption by E2EE service providers.</p><p>Now that you know what end to end encryption is, you should ask yourself: will
you be comfortable giving a box of your personal photos to strangers? Likely
not, and you’d want to lock your box first.</p><p>Similarly, end to end encryption is a way digitally of locking your box of
photos before storing them on the cloud.</p>
