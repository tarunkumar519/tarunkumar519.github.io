00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.847
Help.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.124
Help me!

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.649
Help me, Lord.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.525
I'm dying.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.725
What is this?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.361
Cancer?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480
Mother Mary, full of
grace, protect me

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.528
and guide me in
my hour of death.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.130
It's a test.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.566
Cut it down.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.291
Cut it down.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.200
Shh.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.005
Sue Snell
and Tommy Ross, come on.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.886
Let's go, ladies! In the water!
Caps on, please!

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.807
Chris and Sue,
let's go!

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.564
I want you to keep it
in the air three times. All right?

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.406
We are graduating,
Ms. Desjardin.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.924
Yeah, Sue!

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.565
Get that.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.050
Don't be afraid
of the ball, ladies.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.929
All right, here we go.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.125
All right, Carrie White. Let's
get Carrie into the game.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.886
You can't stand on the sidelines
all the time. Come on.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.005
Whoo!

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.726
Carrie's serve.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.921
Yeah, Carrie White!

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.124
Do it, Carrie!
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.808
Throw it.
Do it. Serve it.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.286
Oh. Ow.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.130
What the hell?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.090
It's so funny,
Chris.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.324
Are you okay?
Yeah.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.645
Oh, my God.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.090
You eat shit.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.685
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.091
No, he didn't.
You're making it up.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.561
He came up to me and I said, "Well,
you have to extend your hand..."

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.130
Now you're lying.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.571
Help! Help! Help me!

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.520
Help me.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.808
Get off me, you freak!
Please.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.962
Oh, my God. Look what
you did to my shirt.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.121
Please!

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.929
Stop! Stop!
Settle down.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.281
I think I'm bleeding
to death. Please.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.164
Oh, my God.
It's period blood.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.526
I'm bleeding.
I think I'm dying.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.602
What? Oh, my God.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.604
Please help me!

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.489
It's just your period.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.451
Just plug it up.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.489
Help me!
Oh, God!

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.802
Oh! She got you.
Help me!

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.323
God, just plug it up!

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.720
Help!

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.602
Plug it up!

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.121
I'm sorry. No!

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.646
No!

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.329
Plug it up!

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.848
Girls, come on!
Move!

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.161
Ladies.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.329
Oh, my God. Okay. All right.
Help me.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.642
Okay, honey, stand up.
Let's get you cleaned up.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.847
Help me, help me.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.126
Oh, Carrie, come on.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.691
Stand up.
Come on, can you stand up?

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.364
It hurts! It hurts!

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.967
It hurts! Something's not right.
Something's not right.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.441
Okay, okay. What are
you talking about?

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.489
Ms. Desjardin, I don't think
she knows it's her period.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.090
No!

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.686
All right, Sue. Get out of here!
You're not helping.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.286
No! No!
Calm down!

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.640
Everyone get out!
Now! Out!

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.520
Okay, deep breaths.
Come here.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.045
Come on. It's okay.
You're okay, sweetie.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.124
It's totally normal.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.446
Shh.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.405
Do you know
what it means?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.326
Okay, sweetie.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.569
Are you, uh,
feeling better?

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.371
Can I get you
some aspirin?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.888
Some juice or something?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.200
Juice?
Really, Henry?

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.762
Maybe you just
want us to leave you alone.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.331
Carrie, honey, I am so
sorry that I slapped you.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.843
I should have
handled it better.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.167
It's totally normal for young
girls to get their periods.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.891
It usually actually happens
a little bit earlier.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.403
Is this your first time?

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.842
Honey, do you understand
what's happening to your body?

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.246
Do you know
what it means?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.446
What?

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.041
I don't know. I felt
something moving down there.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.531
Oh, honey.
Whoa!

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.241
Maybe you could, uh, talk
to a counselor about that

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.084
or a nurse.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.411
Um, what I need to know
is who started throwing...

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.361
...things.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.887
It was Chris Hargensen
and all of her friends.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.087
Cassie...
"Carrie."

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.085
Carrie, did Chris
Hargensen start this?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.011
Honey, you don't
have to protect them.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.923
What they did
was unforgiveable.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.646
Okay, uh...

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.042
It doesn't seem that Carrie
is going to point the finger,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.607
so Ms. Desjardin, I need you
to get to the bottom of this.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.206
Let the punishment
fit the crime.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.281
Okay.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.168
Carrie, you're excused from P.E.
class for the rest of the week.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.527
Just take study hall, okay?
At the library.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.602
Yeah. We're going
to have to call your mom.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.441
What?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.287
We're going to have to
call your mother, Carrie.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.527
I know she's had problems
with us in the past,

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.211
ever since the state
stopped her from

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.850
homeschooling you anymore,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.048
but we've got to bring
her into this, okay?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.121
Mmm-mmm. No.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.725
Sweetie, we have
no choice.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.370
We have to tell your
mom what happened. No.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.521
Carrie.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.051
Hey. Hey, you.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.651
Tina, give it to me.
Give it here.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.768
This is brilliant.
Look at this video.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.242
<i>Plug it up!</i>

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.601
She got her period. On my hand.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.724
That is so disgusting.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.889
It was on my hand and Sue's shirt.
It was so disgusting.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.646
Mmm.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.561
I'm sorry you had to come
to school today, Mom.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.683
Let's go inside,
little girl.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.485
You need to come
inside with me.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.850
Mama, why didn't
you tell me?

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.651
I was so scared, Mama. I
thought I was going to die.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.371
Mama, they laughed at me
and they threw things at me.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.043
We'll talk about
this inside, Carrie.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.087
No.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.525
I want to talk
about it right here.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.250
I don't want to
go inside with you.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.883
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie!

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.569
Crazy Carrie,
Crazy Carrie.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.486
Oh, Lord,
help my child.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.131
She's lost.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.285
Mama, stop it.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.686
Mama!

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.923
I don't want
to upset you.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.484
So, you're a woman now.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.371
And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.681
And what, Carrie? Say it.
No, Mama.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.444
Say it.
Talk to me.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.841
Please just talk to me.
And Eve was weak.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.684
I just want you
to talk to me.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.806
And the first sin was
the sin of intercourse.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.440
Why didn't you
tell me, Mama?

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.404
And God visited
Eve with a curse.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.130
And the curse was
a curse of blood.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.565
I'm not going
to say that.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.768
That's not even in the Bible.
It doesn't say that anywhere.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.810
Oh, Lord. Help this little girl
see the sin of her days and ways.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.961
Show her if she had
remained innocent,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.088
the curse of blood would not have
come upon her as it did on Eve.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.686
I'm not Eve, Mama.
I didn't sin.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.207
You showered with
those other girls.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.486
You had
lust-filled thoughts.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.530
Everyone has to shower, Mama. Everyone.
That's just the rules.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.648
You must be different,
because He can see you.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.643
I don't want to be different, Mama.
I want to be like them.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.210
He can smell
the sin on you.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.009
And He will punish you.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.560
I will not let that come down upon you.
I will not.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.005
Lord have mercy.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.209
No. "The Lord is good. His
unfailing love endures forever,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.762
"and his faithfulness continues
through all generations."

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.921
Psalms 100, verse 5.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.047
I'm going to keep you
away from that school.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.646
You can't. We'll pray.
We'll pray together.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.644
To save our women-weak,
wicked, sinning souls.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.007
You didn't tell me
and they laughed.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.208
I didn't sin,
you sinned.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.930
I did not.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.450
I did not sin.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.210
Go to your closet.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.561
No, Mama.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.165
Go to your closet
and pray.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.520
You pray.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.041
No.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.566
No!

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.721
No!

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.610
Get off me! Mama! Stop it!

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.410
Go to your closet and
pray for forgiveness.

00:17:29.436 --> 00:17:29.867
No!

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.649
You pray.
Mama! Help!

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.288
No, Mommy!
Come on.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.930
Please! Help!

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.250
You pray, little girl.
Pray for forgiveness.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.731
Mommy, let me go!

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.366
Let me out!

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.566
Mom!

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.125
God, you suck!

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.608
Help me. Help me.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.966
What?

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.842
I'm sorry.
What?

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.004
Hey. What's wrong?

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.201
I really messed
up today, Tommy.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.008
What, that thing
with Carrie?

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.445
You know about that?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.848
Yeah, everyone
knows about it,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.685
but you're not responsible
for what Chris does.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.361
Yeah, but it
was me, too.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.763
You threw tampons
at Carrie White?

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.202
I kicked a kid
in the ribs once.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.404
Yeah, while he
was knocked out.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.970
Because this kid,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.805
he used to beat the living shit out
of me every day in sixth grade.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.484
Danny Patrick.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.003
Did you apologize
to Carrie?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.242
Did you apologize
to Danny Patrick?

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.561
No, but we're not in
sixth grade anymore.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.405
Don't.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.569
He was a dick to me.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.521
What did Carrie White
ever do to you?

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.726
Whoo!

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.845
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why he lost his license.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.804
Then why
are you still driving?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.764
I don't need a license
if they can't catch me.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.929
Jackie's email,
Jackie's email!

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.806
Chris no. No!

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.930
Wow. Why don't you two kiss or
something while you're at it?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.365
Oh, baby.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.845
Don't be stupid.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.721
Wait.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.048
Do you think we're going to get
detention because of that?

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.208
Because that would suck.
No.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.489
They should be thanking us for helping
her through her first period.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.562
I got her a tampon.
So what?

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.563
You were only trying
to help her, right?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.210
We should post it.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.405
No, I'm in it.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.442
No one's going to
see you, Teenie.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.531
What?
What are you doing?

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.290
Carrie White.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.840
Favorite movie?

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.967
<i>Bloodsport.</i>

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.763
Favorite drink?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.250
Bloody Mary.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.447
<i>Brightly beams</i>

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.410
<i>Our Father's mercy</i>

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.567
<i>From His
lighthouse evermore</i>

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.291
<i>But to us
He gives the keeping</i>

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.887
<i>Of the lights
along the shore</i>

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.369
<i>Let the lower
lights be burning</i>

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.964
Did you finish
your prayers, little girl?

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.005
Yes, Mama.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.083
That's my good girl.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.490
I love you.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.050
I love you,
too, Mama.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.288
All right, stand up.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.370
Line up, please.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.971
You have a big week coming up.
A big month, actually.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.648
Probably the biggest month of your lives.
Prom and then graduation.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.250
Are you excited?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.242
You probably all
have your dresses.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.763
You have
your dates by now.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.324
What about you, Chris?

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.050
Who's the lucky guy?

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.770
Billy Nolan.
You don't know him.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.001
He doesn't go
to this school.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.560
Are you going to
get him a boutonniere?

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.007
Or are you just going to pin a
bloody tampon to his lapel?

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.244
I so don't need
to hear this.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.685
You're not going anywhere.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.369
What about you, Sue?

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.048
Are you and Tommy busy campaigning
to be Prom King and Queen?

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.043
I would have
voted for you.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.411
Not now.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.167
You all did a shitty
thing yesterday.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.968
A really shitty thing.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.644
And one of you had the
audacity to post a video.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.368
Somebody made
a video of it?

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.965
This is bullshit.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.203
That's it. Thanks to Miss Hargensen,
you're all running suicides.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.611
I'm not doing it.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.406
That's up to you.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.648
That's up to all of you, but anyone
who stops running is suspended.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.724
And if you're suspended,
you're not going to prom.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.803
While you're running, I'd like
for you to think long and hard

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.850
about what it would be
like to be Carrie White.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.721
I'll be okay, Mama.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.121
I'm going to leave work early today
and pick you up after school.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.684
She can't do
this to me.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.842
Just let it go, Chris.
We're almost done.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.410
Then every day
this week?

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.448
All because
of Carrie White?

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.169
Like hell I Will.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.969
Keep moving, Hargensen.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.042
Keep running or
you're not going to prom.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.451
Fuck you!

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.321
This is child abuse.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.401
What did you say to me?

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.531
I'm not going to run
another goddamn inch

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.210
because Carrie White
got her period

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.284
and was too stupid
to know what it was.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.442
- What?
- You're suspended.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.603
You're out of prom and
you're out of my class. Now.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.125
No.
No?

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.965
You can't decide that.
She can't do this to us.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.725
Goodbye, Chris. The rest
of you, keep at it.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.040
Someone could die
of dehydration.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.162
Tina, you have
a heart condition, right?

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.608
If we all stick together, they're
not going to suspend all of us.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.049
They're not going to keep us all from prom.
There would be no prom.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.246
Nik, Lizzy?

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.006
Let's go, ladies!

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.841
Heather?

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.285
This is bullshit! We
didn't do anything wrong.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.010
All right, let's go.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.084
Right, Sue? You're with
me on this, right?

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.446
Come on.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.961
Sue.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.041
Come on.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.603
Keep going, ladies.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.284
This isn't over.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.642
This isn't over
by a long shot.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.804
That's Carrie White.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.524
Um, you know... Sorry.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.729
I was just going to say, you can
make it full-screen. Watch.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.486
All right, who's next?

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.010
Uh, Carrie. Favorite poem.
Did you bring one?

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.607
Yeah.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.762
Why don't you come to
the front of the class

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.126
and share it
with us all?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.846
"This unfrequented place
to find some ease

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.122
"Ease to the body some,
none to the mind

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:54.366
"Times past, and what once
I was and what am now

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.524
"O wherefore was my birth
from Heaven foretold

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.251
"Twice by an Angel,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.921
"Of both my Parents

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.041
"...ascended."

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.125
Okay, uh, that was, uh...

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.483
disturbing.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.609
That is the most
you've said in class all year.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.920
Is there anything
else you'd like to share

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.650
or are you done
scaring us for the day?

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.404
Asshole.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.927
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.
Did you say something?

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.005
I said, "Awesome."

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.201
I just thought what
Carrie read was awesome.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.371
Didn't you,
Mr. Ulmann?

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.443
All right,
who's next? Uh...

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.411
Nicki.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.970
I mean, Lizzy.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.404
Is anyone working?

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.925
Excuse me.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.850
ls anybody working?

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.645
Oh, Margaret.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.766
I'm sorry to disturb you. I don't
know where Hugo and Gloria...

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.604
Can I help you, Mrs. Snell?

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.011
Yes, I'm picking up.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.246
Margaret, I want to say
how sorry I am

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.402
about what happened
at the school.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.644
There's no excuse for what Sue
did, but she's a good girl.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.121
Are any of those
girls good?

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.842
Oh, that is beautiful
work, Margaret.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.406
Thank you.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.649
I love what you've done
with the neckline.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.690
And the stitches.
You can barely see them.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.923
So few people can
sew like this anymore.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.129
I could never do anything
like this myself.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.168
Sue's going
to look beautiful.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.567
I am so excited for her.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.847
I remember my prom.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.810
Anyway,
she's going to love it.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.361
These are Godless times,
Mrs. Snell.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.371
<i>This gym teacher
was running Chrissie</i>

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.965
into the ground
and used profanity.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.849
I believe the term
"shitty" was used.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.524
She can't do that.
It's abuse of power.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.405
You're right, Daddy.
That's what she said.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.881
"Shitty."
She's really abusive.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.487
Ms. Desjardin was reprimanded for
what happened in class today.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.642
But you know we've had
a lot of problems

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.801
with your daughter
in the past.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.407
And now, with what she did to
her classmate, Carrie White.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.642
The girl was having her...

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.210
What your daughter
and her posse...

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.681
I'm not going to sit here
and listen to half-truths.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.842
I know my daughter. She
said she didn't do it.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.888
I want her prom
privileges restored.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.681
You can't prove she did
anything, can you?

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.450
I believe that there is a
video of the incident.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.687
And I think your
daughter is the one who took it.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.808
I think a video like
that would probably

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.325
be pretty damning
to anyone in it

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.084
and to the person
who made it.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.924
Don't you,
Mr. Hargensen?

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.321
I don't know.
I'm just a gym teacher,

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.323
but it seems like
a video like that

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.368
would probably affect
college admissions,

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:29.769
possibly a lawsuit,
tons of bad publicity.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.446
I wonder what <i>The Today Show</i>
would do with a video like that.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.524
I think we should just look at
her phone and if it's not there,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.400
I owe you a huge apology and she
should be allowed to go to prom.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.761
Chris.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.325
Chris.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.123
Daddy, I'm not
going to give them my phone.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.690
I have personal
things on here.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.928
Isn't that invasion
of privacy or something?

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.043
Chrissie, if you want
to go to prom,

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.726
just give them the damn phone
and we can be done with this.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.881
I have to get
back to work.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.041
Dad.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.930
God damn it, just give
them your phone, Chris.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.246
No.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.523
So, I'm officially
out of the prom.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.931
I bet that cocksucker Morton
loses his job, though.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.489
My dad is suing him.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.206
Jesus, Sue, why didn't
you stand up for me?

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.848
We could have had
them by the balls.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.409
We deserved it for what
we did to Carrie White.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.250
I thought
I deserved it.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.602
Desjardin was right. We did a
shitty thing for no reason.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.648
Bullshit!

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.724
That Carrie goes around saying that
everyone but her and her mother

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.201
are going to hell and you
stuck up for her? Come on!

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.641
You can be such
a pig sometimes, Chris.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.051
What did Carrie White
ever do to you?

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.805
She's been begging for it
since the sixth grade, Sue.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.370
I got to go.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.087
I seem to remember
you were in there

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.003
throwing shit
with the rest of us.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.447
What was it that
she was calling her?

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.488
"Freak"?
I stopped.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.889
Oh, you stopped?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.889
Yeah.
Why did you keep running?

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.201
Hmm?

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.289
Why did you keep running, Sue?
Stop it, Chris!

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.886
You kept running,
Sue, little Suze,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.645
because you've been
dreaming about senior year

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.291
and the perfect boyfriend
and the perfect prom

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.010
your whole
goddamned life.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.764
You already booked
the hotel,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.683
already practiced the sounds
you're going to make

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.411
when you and Tommy make love.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.123
That's why you had this
bullshit change of heart.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.567
You don't give a shit
about Carrie White.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.924
And everybody knows it.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.369
Okay. I'll see you
around, Sue.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.961
Carrie?

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.727
Carrie?

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.569
I'm not going to let anyone
hurt you, little girl.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.770
You're safe here with me.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.640
Got it.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.841
Hey.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.209
How are you doing?
Good.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.520
Good?
Yeah.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.000
What's up?

00:38:44.026 --> 00:38:46.747
I want you to take
Carrie White to prom.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.284
Good one, babe.
Come on.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.246
Are you serious?

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.924
I'm just trying
to fix what I did.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.606
Yeah.
I get that, but this is...

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.727
Sue, it's nuts.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.086
Okay, so it's nuts.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.607
But after what we did to
her, I have to do something.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.603
I have to do something
that counts.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.966
Uh...

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.486
What even makes you
think that she would say yes to me?

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.561
She'd say yes.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.244
We've barely even spoken.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.005
I saw how she looked at you in
class when you rescued her.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.162
What girl doesn't
want to go to prom?

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.481
What girl doesn't
want one magical night?

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.530
Maybe I can give
that up for her.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.171
No. Babe, I want you
to have that magic night.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.964
I don't want to go to prom
with Carrie White.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.451
I want to go
to prom with you.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.525
I can't go.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.811
Hey, Carrie.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.120
I was looking for you
at the library

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.406
because that's where
they said you were.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.848
But, uh, you weren't there, so
I figured maybe you were here.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.167
<i>"Telekinesis:
Unlocking the Mind."</i>

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.369
No, no.
Is that about, uh, hypnosis?

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.449
Because me and my friends,
we tried that.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.807
We actually hypnotized
my boy's dog.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.401
Anyway, um...

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.011
How are you doing?

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.526
I'm okay.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.321
Cool.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.802
So you know how, um,
prom is next week?

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.086
You know?

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.329
Um, I was wondering, if you don't have a
date already, maybe you want to go with me.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.201
What?

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.681
The prom.
Next week.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.001
Carrie.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.721
Hey.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.324
Carrie.
Stop!

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.251
Please, just stop
trying to trick me.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.846
No, I'm not trying to trick you.
I'm not tricking you.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.286
Aren't you
with Sue Snell?

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.250
Yeah, I'm with Sue Snell,
but she doesn't want to go.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.006
I'm sorry.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.848
Did one of the girls
try something again?

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.841
No.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.563
I got invited to prom.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.561
Really?

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.525
That's great news.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.531
With who?

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.164
It's Tommy Ross.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.801
Wow. Tommy Ross?

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.486
He is pretty dreamy, huh?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.001
Yeah.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.762
I know who he
goes around with.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.968
They're just going
to trick me again.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.166
Right?

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.243
Maybe he really meant it.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.161
No.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.283
Yes, of course he did.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.521
Why?

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.728
Why would he
want to go with me?

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.641
Come here.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.964
Do you know
what I see?

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.763
I see a beautiful
young woman.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.963
Maybe wear
a little make-up.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.963
Pinch your cheeks
a little bit,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.929
put some color in there.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.050
Curl your hair.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.124
Stand up straight.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.370
There you go.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.370
Come on, Sue.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.488
You and Chris are best friends.
If you two...

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.728
If you three are planning
on playing a joke

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.848
on a lonely,
defenseless girl...

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.331
This has nothing
to do with Chris.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.966
Or you, Miss Desjardin.
And for me...

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.207
Listen, with due respect, Miss
Desjardin, this is between Sue and me.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.721
It's kind of like
a private thing.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.643
And what is
the big deal anyway?

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.960
It's just for
one night, right?

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.840
Famous athletes
like Tim Tebow,

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.402
he takes kids to prom all the time
and everyone loves him for it.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.246
Really?

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.770
You're hardly
a famous athlete.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.291
This is a really big deal for her.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.566
Listen.
It doesn't matter.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.565
She said no.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.563
So you'll try again.
Don't.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.920
Okay.
It's not okay.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.327
Tommy,

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.284
when you show up to prom with
Carrie White on your arm,

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.443
don't you think you're going to
look the tiniest bit ridiculous?

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.807
We don't care how we look.
Do we?

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.321
No.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.126
Come on.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.726
What are you doing here?

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.325
Aren't you
going to ask me in?

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.402
What do you want?
You can't be here.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.211
Right to the point, huh?
Cool. About the prom.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.286
You kind of
left me hanging.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.885
I already told you.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.486
I know, but I was hoping
that you'd change your mind.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.163
Girls change their
mind all the time.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.366
Why are you doing this?

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.805
Because I want to.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.164
You need to leave.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.043
I'm not leaving
until you say yes.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.930
Why is this so
important to you?

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.162
Because I think that we
would have a good time.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.568
And because I think that what
you read in class was cool.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.321
I looked up that book
in the library myself.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.691
That's the guy who brought the
temple down. Samson, right?

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.241
Yes.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.603
Yes, okay, I'll go.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.444
I have to be back
by 10:30.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.571
Sure, okay. Um...

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.808
I'll pick you up
here at 7:00?

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.361
Okay.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.966
Crazy, right?
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.367
Where have you been? I was worried sick.
Come on. Come inside.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.284
I'm sorry I'm late, Mama.
Just get inside.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.567
Your supper's cold. I'm going
to have to heat it up.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.051
I didn't know...

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.731
You're immodest.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.325
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.890
No, Mama. I took a
bus to Main Street

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.371
and I bought cloth
for a dress.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.760
You are not to go anywhere but to
school and back. You know that.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.605
Mama, before you say anything
else, I've been asked to prom.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.811
Mama, I've been
asked to prom.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.484
Oh, God, why?

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.211
It's next Saturday and
he's a very nice boy.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.247
And he'll come and
meet you before

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.084
and he promised to
have me home by 10:30.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.720
No, no, no.
I already accepted.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.084
I know this scares you.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.605
It scares me, too.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.761
The other kids,

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.884
they think I'm weird.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.090
But I don't want to be.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.444
I have to try to be
a whole person.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.884
Before it's too late.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.205
He'll hurt you.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.970
No, Mama.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.361
No, Mama, there are bad
people, but not Tommy.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.681
He's good. You'll like him.
He's a very nice boy.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.001
Boys, boys.
After the blood,

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.004
comes the boys sniffing,
slobbering like dogs.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.366
Stop it, Mama.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.171
He's going to paw at you until he finds
where that blood smell comes from.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.446
He's going to
take you, Carrie,

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.646
in his car out
to the wilderness,

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.848
out where it's cold and the
roadhouses are and the whiskey.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.126
Stop being so crazy.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.440
You tell that boy
you're not going.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.567
No.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.563
We'll move from here. We're
never going to stop moving.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.444
You're going to go to your
closet and you're going to pray.

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.807
You're going to get in there and
you're going to pray for forgiveness.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.291
No, never again, Mama!

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.965
Mama, stand up.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.131
Mama, stand up!

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.040
Mama, I'm going.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.411
Witch.
I'm not a witch, Mama.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.681
There are no witches.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.808
The devil's got her now.
Like he did before.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.850
It's not the devil, Mama. There are
other people out there like me

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.921
who can do
what I can do.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.850
You poor child. Don't you know
he's working through you?

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.167
Mama, it's inherited. it was
passed down from Grandma

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.480
and it skipped you.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.928
You know that.
Maybe it came from Daddy.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.446
He gave me a cancer.
I thought you were cancer.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.849
That's awful. Don't say that.
She's lost to me.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.321
Pray all you want, Mama,
but I'm going.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.449
And nothing's going
to stop me.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.728
And I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.090
What are we doing?

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.367
What does this have to do
with Carrie White?

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.809
Baby, you said you wanted us
to do something about her.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.891
It's a piggy!

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.043
Here, piggy, piggy.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.722
Here, piggy, piggy.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.131
It smells
like shit in here.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.203
Chris, pick one. Pick one
that looks like her.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.609
Pig's blood for a pig.

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.520
That one.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.801
Go on.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.281
One quick swing,
all right?

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.811
I got this.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.526
Don't worry,
little piggy,

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.807
Uncle Jack is going
to bash your head right in.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.766
You're not going
to feel one...

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.729
Shut up!
Do it already. Jesus.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.286
I can't.

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.648
God, you guys are
such goddamn pussies.

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.881
Shut up!

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.646
I'm sorry, Billy.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.485
Come on, you got this.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.762
All right, it's just
one quick slice and...

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.366
Oh, my God.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.281
Good job, baby.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.007
Sue.
Hey, are you okay?

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.891
There we go.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.767
Billy. Hurry up.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.730
Oh, my God.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.963
When the time comes, I'll let
you pull the rope, okay?

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.371
Oh, I plan on it.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.171
Did you guys
see Sue today?

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.089
She looked awful.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.520
I know Chris isn't coming.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.761
She's suspended.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.001
Do you think she'll crash?

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.360
You never know
with Chris, right?

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.444
So, I think I'm going
to have the after-party.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.201
No.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.609
What do you think?
Down?

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.801
No.

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.247
Yeah.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.281
Whoo!

00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:57.405
Will you pin it
on me, Mama?

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.041
Red.

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.011
I might have known
it would be red.

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.320
It's pink.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.889
I can see your dirty pillows.
Everyone will.

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.486
Breasts, Mama.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.401
Breasts. You have them
and every woman has them.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.603
Take off
that dress, Carrie.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.521
No.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.411
Take it off and we'll burn it
together and pray for forgiveness.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.925
Mama, it's modest.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.843
Call that boy and tell
him you're not going.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.366
You just tell him
you're sick.

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.771
I don't want you
to get hurt.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.047
Or you could just
be happy for me.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.204
Mama, stop hurting yourself.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.728
You know it's not going
to make me stay.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.081
He's not coming.
It's a trick.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.484
Same as always.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.370
He's going to come.

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.805
They're going
to laugh at you.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.166
They're all going
to laugh at you.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.242
Mama, stop it.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.084
I'm nervous enough
as it is.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.201
Thank you, sir.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.489
You see, Mama?

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.011
You see, it's all
going to be okay.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.686
Oh, repent.
It's not too late.

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:30.048
Mama, don't ruin this for me.
I'll be home early.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.600
I'm going to have to
tell that boy the truth

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.045
that your father took me
and you were born of sin.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.690
You'll say nothing, Mama.
And from that sin...

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.766
From that sin
was born another.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.171
The worst sin.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.890
"A man or a woman
who is a witch

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.450
"among you is to
be put to death.

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.681
"You are to stone them."

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.284
I'm warning you, Mama.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.600
The devil's hand.

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.125
Please don't do this.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.368
There will be
a judgment, Carrie.

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.046
As Jezebel fell from
the tower, you too...

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.645
Mama, you're not going to say
another word until I'm gone.

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.890
Mommy, I'm sorry.

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.485
I love you.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.170
I'll be home early.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.241
Hi.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.041
Hi.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.204
Do I look okay?

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.805
You look beautiful.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.843
Tommy, can we
wait a minute?

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.842
Yeah, sure, we can wait
as long as you want.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.005
Are you scared?

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.250
They're not that bad.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.364
Besides, I need you
in there.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.284
Dancing by myself all night,
I'd look awful silly.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.324
Here, let me fix this.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.208
I think this is supposed
to go on your wrist.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.961
There.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.806
Are you ready?

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.120
God, you look
handsome, Ross.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.328
Dawson!

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.402
Don't worry. If they kill each
other, I'll dance with you.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.404
Carrie, this is my best
buddy, George Dawson.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.450
And this is his girlfriend, Erika.
She goes to Dover.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.521
Hi.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.611
Come on, I'll show
you the table.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.648
I love your dress.
Where did you get it?

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.051
I made it.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.610
No kidding. Really?

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.250
Yeah.
That's amazing.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.166
Do you want
to dance?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.524
Or, if you want, we could
wait for a slower song.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.201
Yeah.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.646
I'll be back.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.369
Miss Desjardin.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.201
You look beautiful.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.124
I'll let you two ladies talk.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.487
Uh, do you want
some punch?

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.528
I heard Greg
and Harry spiked it.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.761
Really?

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.324
No, I'm just kidding.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.327
You're doing okay?

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.164
Yeah.
Yeah?

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.807
Listen.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.122
Do you really have
to be home so early?

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.726
I promised.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.689
Yeah, I know.
I understand.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.526
But, um, a bunch of people, we're
going to the Cavalier after.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.682
That's okay.
What is?

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.006
I know you want to hang out with
your friends, and that's...

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.047
No.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.530
It's a slow song.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.601
No.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.167
Yeah. Come on.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.242
No, Tommy.
I've never danced before.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.886
It's okay. No, I can't.
I can't do it.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.770
You can't go to prom and not
have at least one dance.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.887
I can't.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.487
Carrie White, will you
have this dance with me?

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.686
Come on.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.926
Come on.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.085
It's so easy. Take this hand in my hand.
Like this, see?

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.971
You're going to put this
hand on my shoulder.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.485
And I put my hand
on your hip.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.011
Then we sway.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.171
See, it's easy.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.923
You've got nothing
to worry about.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.729
And you're good,
you're a good learner.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.567
And then, if you want
to get fancy with it,

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.688
we can do the
<i>Dancing With The Stars.</i>

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.171
Yeah.
No.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.885
Yeah. Ready? Look.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.884
To the first one.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.565
This is fun, right?

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.011
Tommy, why am I here?

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.128
Because I invited you.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.406
But why?

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.970
Carrie, we're here.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.891
We're at prom. I'm having
such a great time with you.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.241
You are?

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.401
Yeah.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.920
And I hope that you're
having a good time with me.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.401
Yeah.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.083
So, what do you say
we dance a little longer,

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:41.204
and then we see which poor fool
they crown King and Queen,

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.931
and then we go to the Cavalier?

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.645
And I'll have you home by 10:30.
How does that sound to you?

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.445
Yeah.
Yeah?

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.124
Maybe 11:00.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.446
Whatever you want.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.291
11:00.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.247
<i>All right, everyone,
take your seats. Take your seats.</i>

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.766
<i>It's now time to
vote for your King</i>

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.003
<i>and Queen of the prom. All right.</i>

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:53.085
<i>Ballots are on the table.
Everyone gets their own, please.</i>

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.162
<i>Guys, take your seats.</i>

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.641
Here.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.371
<i>Make an "X" beside
the candidate of your choice.</i>

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.443
<i>Let's have
the best prom ever.</i>

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.806
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.531
<i>All right.</i>

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.331
Tommy, we're on here.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.401
Don't you want
to be on there?

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.766
Do you?

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.126
Why not?

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.850
If we win, the only
thing that happens is

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.684
we have to go up there
on those thrones,

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.807
wave a scepter around while
they play the school song,

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.527
and then, uh, do a little dance so
everyone can see how idiotic we look.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.444
They are beautiful.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.249
You're beautiful.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.371
So, who do we vote for?

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.041
I guess they're
more your crowd than mine.

01:08:47.067 --> 01:08:48.227
I don't really have a crowd.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.362
Well, I think we vote
for ourselves, right?

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.042
No. No,
don't vote for us.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.123
To the devil
with false modesty.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.930
To the devil.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.722
Hurt yourself?
No.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.644
To my boy, George Dawson,
to the Fearsome Four,

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.843
Mike, Matt, Brian, and Brad.
I'm going to miss you guys.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.161
- All set?
- Oh, yeah.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.081
Good luck, kids.
You've got my vote.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.160
More ballots for you.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.446
Hey, girl.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.970
Here you go.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.484
As soon as that
bucket goes, we run.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.523
We don't stick around for the
laughs or the screams or anything.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.561
All right?

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.200
You got it?

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.130
Are you listening? Hey.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.450
What?
When they get up there,

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.329
what's happening? You're pulling
the rope and when the...

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.721
Shut up so I can hear.
Hey. Listen to me. Listen.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.928
If you get caught and you say
anything about what we did,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.570
I will fucking kill you.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.529
This isn't what you bitches
did in the shower.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.761
This is criminal assault.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.922
This is fucking jail time
if we're caught.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.161
I get it.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.889
Hey. Whatever happens
tonight, you're Queen, okay?

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.329
And the results are in.
And it was very, very close.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.840
A drum roll, please.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.891
By one vote,
our winners are...

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.047
Tommy Ross
and Carrie White!

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.406
Come on.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.930
Way to go, Carrie.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.290
Heather, where's Chris?

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.442
What are you talking about?
She's not here.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.324
Hey, what's wrong? Come on, go.
You can do this.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.843
We are fucking doing this.
It's too late to go back now.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.650
Ewen High...

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.771
I give you your newly crowned
King and Queen of the prom,

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.925
Tommy Ross
and Carrie White.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.083
Pull it!
Shut up, Billy!

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.691
Chris.
Sue?

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.201
Sue.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.089
What are you doing? Come on.
Come on, let's go.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.362
No! Miss Desjardin,
it's not me. It's Chris.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.965
Pull it, Billy, pull it!

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.246
Don't ruin this
for Carrie.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.890
It's not me!
Come on. Out.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.641
Let her have this.
No, wait!

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.565
What the hell?

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:51.043
<i>Plug it up!</i>

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.528
<i>Please help me!</i>

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.322
<i>Plug it up!</i>

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.923
Carrie, wait.
Carrie.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.125
<i>Help me.</i>

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.880
<i>No!</i>

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.809
<i>Freak! Freak!
Come on.</i>

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.930
Carrie, come on.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.481
Tommy.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.446
Tommy.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.685
Tommy, no.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.161
No.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.684
Fuck.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.646
You have an inch.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.960
Yeah. Come on.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.010
Go, go. Come on.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.528
Come on.
Are you seeing this?

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.243
Wait.
Come on.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.606
There's been an explosion.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.406
Don't panic!

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.521
Bleachers!

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.045
We have to
get to the door.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.321
Nicki!

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.688
Lizzy!
Nicki!

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.762
- Come on! We got to go!
- Okay.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.006
Tina, come on!

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.366
We're all going to die!

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.960
Come on!

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.805
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.411
Nothing. Do you think
this is a fucking game?

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.845
Shut up.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.644
What are we going to do?

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.922
We're going to leave town and
we're never going to come back.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.928
Okay? It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.121
Okay.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.163
Oh, my God!
Watch out!

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.205
Shit town!

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.171
Go, move!

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.691
Oh, my God.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.325
It's Carrie.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.967
Run her down.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.521
Kill her.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.602
Kill her, Billy.
Kill her, Billy! Kill her!

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.966
Shut up! I got this.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.285
Come on!

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.006
Billy?

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.121
Billy?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.081
Billy?

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.726
No.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.851
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.161
Mama?

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.966
Mama?

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.406
Mama?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.161
Mama!

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.887
No.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.126
No.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.041
No.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.045
I'm so sorry.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.086
Mama?

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.881
Mama?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.331
Oh, Mama.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.524
Mama, you were right.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.928
They laughed at me, Mommy.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.403
They all laughed at me.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.562
I knew they'd hurt
my little girl.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.401
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.963
We slept in
the same bed,

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.210
lived together sinlessly.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.681
Then one night, I saw him
look at me in that way.

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.927
And we got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.804
And that's when
he took me.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.487
No, Mama.
I don't want to hear it.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.847
And I liked it.
Mama, no.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.561
I should have given you to God
when you were born, but...

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.365
I was weak.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.721
And I loved you so much.

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.604
And I said, "God,

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.721
"let me keep
my little girl.

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.884
"Let me keep her."

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.166
Let's pray.

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:49.691
Yes, Mama.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.725
Yes, we'll pray.

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.522
I'll be the preacher.
You'll be my congregation.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.888
"Our Father,
Who art in heaven,

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.244
"hallowed be Thy name.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.324
"Thy kingdom come,

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.685
"Thy will be done

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.565
"on earth

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.244
"as it is in heaven."

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.246
Mama!

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.851
Mama, please.

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.683
No, Mama. Mama, please.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:46.087
This isn't your fault,
Carrie. It's mine.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.004
Mommy, this isn't right.
You know the devil never dies.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.846
He keeps coming back.
You've got to keep killin' him.

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:56.606
No, Mama.
Over and over again.

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.603
Mama, please. Mama!

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.845
No!

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.286
No, Mama.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.885
Mama, stop it!

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.322
Carrie.
I'm sorry.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.606
Carrie!

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.406
Okay.

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:08.571
It's okay.

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:20.244
It's okay. No one's
going to hurt you.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.608
No one's going to hurt you.

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.886
Carrie?

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.769
Let me help you,
Carrie.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.202
Why couldn't you
leave me alone?

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.486
I'm sorry.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.482
Look what you
turned me into.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:02.290
Don't hurt me,
Carrie.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.885
Why not?

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.444
I've been hurt
my whole life.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.648
I killed my mom.

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.170
I want her back.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.210
I'm scared.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.809
We've got to
get out of here!

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:59.410
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:01.806
Come on!

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.168
It's a girl.
What?

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.731
You don't know?

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.171
Oh, my God.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.851
Get out!

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.891
Get out!

01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.006
It's okay.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.564
You're doing great.
That's just another contraction.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.041
Okay.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.641
Sue, do me
a favor and push.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.803
No, something doesn't feel right.
It doesn't feel right.

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.360
Come on now, breathe.
Try again, Sue. Try again.

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.726
Everything's okay.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.084
There we go. Ready?

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.286
It hurts! Please help me!

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.001
Just lay back, okay, Sue?

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.487
There you go.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.761
Almost there.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.007
Is it normal?

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.651
All right, just push!
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.926
Hold her still!

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.081
Sue, push!

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.925
Sue, I need you
to breathe!

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:23.601
Now, get ready
for the next one.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.485
Push! You can do it!
Come on!

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.761
Wake up, baby!

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.527
It's okay, it's okay.
I gotcha.

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.451
It's over, baby! It's over!

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.045
Sue, you're all right!

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.441
You're all right!

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.281
Baby, wake up!

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.003
<i>I can hardly make you mine</i>

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.524
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:27.041
<i>At the end of a long day
and when I wake</i>

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:32.961
<i>If you could just
give me a sign</i>

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.330
<i>We could leave it all behind</i>

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.569
<i>Stop taking the long
way before we play</i>

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.003
<i>I don't think I can make it
and I know you're the one</i>

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:57.923
<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.561
<i>Well, I can hardly
make you mine</i>

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:39.170
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.607
<i>But you never wanted,
but you had to take</i>

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:51.247
<i>So I can never give you up</i>

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:55.087
<i>I guess it's 'cause
it's just a crush</i>

01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:01.211
<i>Before the end of a long
day and then I wake</i>

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.250
<i>But I know you're not
the one or the only</i>

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.124
<i>But we both know what
it's like to be lonely</i>

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.884
<i>Well, these fantasies,
they left us lonely</i>

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.288
<i>Boy, just bring all
your love back to me</i>

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.405
<i>I guess for now
this is how it'll be</i>

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.006
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.251
<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.408
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:03.409
<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>
