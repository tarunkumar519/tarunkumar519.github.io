00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:15.042
Hey!

4
00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:44.336
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

5
00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:51.335
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

6
00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:52.944
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

7
00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:55.336
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

8
00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:59.212
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

9
00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:00.780
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

10
00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:04.286
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

11
00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:08.461
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

12
00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:10.386
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

13
00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:13.106
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

14
00:02:13.177 --> 00:02:14.514
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

15
00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:18.721
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

16
00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:21.720
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

17
00:02:21.813 --> 00:02:23.271
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

18
00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:24.154
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

19
00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:26.310
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

20
00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:27.492
<i>Under my administration,</i>

21
00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:31.346
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

22
00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:34.955
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

23
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.156
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

24
00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.188
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

25
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.604
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

26
00:02:39.682 --> 00:02:40.580
<i>But listen...</i>

27
00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:42.064
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

28
00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:43.591
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

29
00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:49.096
Hey.

30
00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:53.159
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

31
00:02:58.438 --> 00:02:59.964
Why is she still tied?

32
00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:07.520
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

33
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:16.923
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

34
00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:18.862
Just call me in the morning, okay?

35
00:03:22.037 --> 00:03:24.429
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

36
00:03:24.512 --> 00:03:27.075
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

37
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.800
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

38
00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:50.728
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

39
00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:06.228
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

40
00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:11.012
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

41
00:05:14.476 --> 00:05:17.899
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

42
00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:20.868
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

43
00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:23.838
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

44
00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:26.560
<i>Watching.</i>

45
00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:32.499
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

46
00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.583
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

47
00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.884
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

48
00:05:56.048 --> 00:05:58.647
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

49
00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.214
<i>It's a big city.</i>

50
00:06:04.868 --> 00:06:06.559
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

51
00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:18.931
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

52
00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:25.778
Look at this guy, man.

53
00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:31.882
Boom!

54
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:33.201
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

55
00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.778
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

56
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:40.263
Yo, let's see your hits.

57
00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:42.448
That's you.

58
00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:06.576
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

59
00:07:08.317 --> 00:07:10.544
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

60
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.390
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

61
00:07:14.957 --> 00:07:16.483
<i>It's a warning.</i>

62
00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:19.245
<i>To them.</i>

63
00:07:28.855 --> 00:07:30.052
<i>Fear...</i>

64
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:35.124
<i>is a tool.</i>

65
00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:49.229
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

66
00:08:00.993 --> 00:08:03.509
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

67
00:08:14.804 --> 00:08:16.702
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

68
00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:36.906
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

69
00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.339
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

70
00:08:39.422 --> 00:08:40.865
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

71
00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:43.051
Help!

72
00:08:43.134 --> 00:08:44.330
Somebody help me!

73
00:08:45.113 --> 00:08:47.093
Help, help!

74
00:08:53.898 --> 00:08:55.095
Where you goin', huh?

75
00:08:59.837 --> 00:09:00.786
Come on.

76
00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:02.518
Come on, man. Break it.

77
00:09:04.663 --> 00:09:06.065
You can't move, huh?

78
00:09:06.437 --> 00:09:08.127
Now knock his ass out.

79
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.900
Showtime. Showtime, man.

80
00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:11.509
Come on, man.

81
00:09:11.591 --> 00:09:12.828
Come on. Do it, man.

82
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.370
You see this guy?

83
00:09:56.506 --> 00:09:58.113
The hell are you supposed to be?

84
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:16.219
I'm vengeance.

85
00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:19.230
Holy shit. It's him.

86
00:10:44.635 --> 00:10:45.749
Hey, man. No, no, no!

87
00:11:27.158 --> 00:11:28.520
Please don't hurt me.

88
00:12:04.153 --> 00:12:05.721
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:08.484
Police action.

90
00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.711
He's with me, Officer.

91
00:12:12.938 --> 00:12:14.506
Are you kidding me, sir?

92
00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:17.145
You're gonna let him in here?

93
00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:20.568
Martinez, let him through.

94
00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:35.787
Goddamn freak.

95
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.573
What do we know?

96
00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:04.757
Detective?

97
00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:06.448
Sorry, Lieutenant.

98
00:13:07.314 --> 00:13:11.769
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

99
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.645
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

100
00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:20.388
All this blood is from his head?

101
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:21.831
No.

102
00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:27.317
Excuse me.

103
00:13:29.586 --> 00:13:31.441
Most of it's from his hand.

104
00:13:36.844 --> 00:13:37.875
Thumb was severed.

105
00:13:39.534 --> 00:13:41.719
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

106
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.988
He was alive when it was cut off.

107
00:13:45.266 --> 00:13:46.668
Ecchymosis...

108
00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:49.432
around the wound.

109
00:14:04.535 --> 00:14:06.226
Security detail downstairs

110
00:14:06.309 --> 00:14:08.495
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

111
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.165
The mayor was up here alone.

112
00:14:14.557 --> 00:14:17.238
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

113
00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:25.322
You said there was a card.

114
00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:26.971
Yeah.

115
00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:40.054
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

116
00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:43.024
Haven't a clue?

117
00:14:43.107 --> 00:14:45.457
Let's play a game, just me and you.

118
00:14:46.538 --> 00:14:49.054
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

119
00:14:50.374 --> 00:14:52.436
There's a cipher too.

120
00:14:59.117 --> 00:15:00.974
Any of this mean anything to you?

121
00:15:03.489 --> 00:15:04.685
What's going on here?

122
00:15:07.737 --> 00:15:09.139
I asked him to come, Pete.

123
00:15:09.221 --> 00:15:10.872
This is a crime scene.

124
00:15:10.954 --> 00:15:13.264
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

125
00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:15.326
I got the press downstairs.

126
00:15:15.409 --> 00:15:18.130
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

127
00:15:18.213 --> 00:15:20.027
But this is way over the line.

128
00:15:23.657 --> 00:15:24.729
Wait.

129
00:15:24.811 --> 00:15:26.502
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

130
00:15:26.585 --> 00:15:27.699
How do you know?

131
00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:30.750
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

132
00:15:30.834 --> 00:15:32.565
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

133
00:15:32.648 --> 00:15:34.256
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

134
00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:35.865
He lies still.

135
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.440
Excuse me?

136
00:15:39.966 --> 00:15:41.038
The riddle.

137
00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:44.997
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

138
00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:55.514
Oh, Jesus.

139
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:01.495
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

140
00:16:02.484 --> 00:16:04.299
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

141
00:16:05.082 --> 00:16:06.691
Excuse me, Commissioner.

142
00:16:07.763 --> 00:16:09.413
They're ready for your statement.

143
00:16:13.413 --> 00:16:15.104
I want him outta here.

144
00:16:15.723 --> 00:16:16.795
Now!

145
00:16:23.311 --> 00:16:24.508
Come on.

146
00:16:37.169 --> 00:16:38.366
Yeah.

147
00:16:39.603 --> 00:16:41.005
The kid found him.

148
00:16:45.954 --> 00:16:48.923
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

149
00:17:05.173 --> 00:17:07.318
We really gotta go, man.

150
00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:16.515
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

151
00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:18.783
A wife lost a husband.

152
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.506
And I lost a friend.

153
00:17:22.578 --> 00:17:25.093
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

154
00:17:25.176 --> 00:17:28.228
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

155
00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:30.827
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

156
00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:34.951
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

157
00:17:35.033 --> 00:17:39.075
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

158
00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:40.395
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

159
00:17:40.478 --> 00:17:43.282
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

160
00:17:43.514 --> 00:17:45.081
<i>but I don't know.</i>

161
00:17:50.938 --> 00:17:53.784
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

162
00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:55.928
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

163
00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:57.991
<i>And now this.</i>

164
00:18:00.136 --> 00:18:01.703
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

165
00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:05.621
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

166
00:18:07.682 --> 00:18:09.951
<i>But I have to try.</i>

167
00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:11.972
<i>Push myself.</i>

168
00:18:57.646 --> 00:19:00.120
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

169
00:19:01.069 --> 00:19:02.966
<i>behind the mask.</i>

170
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.689
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

171
00:19:11.462 --> 00:19:13.607
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

172
00:19:15.957 --> 00:19:17.524
<i>everything that happened.</i>

173
00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:33.485
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

174
00:19:33.568 --> 00:19:37.404
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

175
00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:40.290
<i>was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

176
00:19:40.374 --> 00:19:42.105
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

177
00:19:42.188 --> 00:19:43.837
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

178
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.405
<i>still have not been released,</i>

179
00:19:45.487 --> 00:19:48.333
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

180
00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:51.632
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

181
00:19:51.756 --> 00:19:53.530
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

182
00:19:53.612 --> 00:19:56.128
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

183
00:19:56.261 --> 00:20:00.467
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

184
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:02.282
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

185
00:20:02.364 --> 00:20:04.303
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

186
00:20:04.385 --> 00:20:07.189
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

187
00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:11.067
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

188
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:12.923
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

189
00:20:13.005 --> 00:20:15.645
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

190
00:20:15.727 --> 00:20:18.944
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

191
00:20:19.027 --> 00:20:22.945
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

192
00:20:23.027 --> 00:20:27.151
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

193
00:20:27.234 --> 00:20:28.636
I assume you heard about this.

194
00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:31.730
Yeah.

195
00:20:38.758 --> 00:20:40.077
Oh, I see.

196
00:20:40.903 --> 00:20:42.800
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

197
00:20:43.336 --> 00:20:44.532
Dear God.

198
00:20:53.193 --> 00:20:55.214
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

199
00:21:03.132 --> 00:21:05.401
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

200
00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:10.309
The killer left this for the Batman?

201
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:13.361
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

202
00:21:13.444 --> 00:21:14.434
Apparently.

203
00:21:14.722 --> 00:21:16.578
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

204
00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:19.919
Why is he writing to you?

205
00:21:20.001 --> 00:21:21.403
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

206
00:21:21.486 --> 00:21:22.517
I don't know yet.

207
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.125
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

208
00:21:25.981 --> 00:21:27.384
Have a shower.

209
00:21:28.827 --> 00:21:30.477
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

210
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.467
are coming for breakfast.

211
00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.529
Here? Why?

212
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:34.683
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

213
00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:35.838
I haven't got time for this.

214
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:37.571
It's getting serious, Bruce.

215
00:21:37.653 --> 00:21:40.705
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

216
00:21:40.787 --> 00:21:42.355
I don't care about that.

217
00:21:43.262 --> 00:21:44.129
Any of that.

218
00:21:44.211 --> 00:21:45.696
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

219
00:21:48.046 --> 00:21:51.140
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

220
00:21:51.222 --> 00:21:53.366
If I can't change things here,

221
00:21:53.902 --> 00:21:55.800
if I can't have an effect,

222
00:21:56.872 --> 00:21:58.481
then I don't care what happens to me.

223
00:21:58.564 --> 00:21:59.677
That's what I'm afraid of.

224
00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:01.368
Alfred, stop.

225
00:22:02.729 --> 00:22:04.172
You're not my father.

226
00:22:06.935 --> 00:22:08.337
I'm well aware.

227
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.508
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

228
00:23:09.922 --> 00:23:11.489
Some fresh berries there.

229
00:23:18.583 --> 00:23:19.697
What are you doing?

230
00:23:20.069 --> 00:23:23.698
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

231
00:23:24.068 --> 00:23:27.946
This is actually quite elusive.

232
00:23:30.915 --> 00:23:32.565
Where'd you get those O's?

233
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.854
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

234
00:23:37.036 --> 00:23:39.428
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

235
00:23:39.511 --> 00:23:43.512
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

236
00:23:43.594 --> 00:23:44.955
see where it leads.

237
00:23:46.902 --> 00:23:47.892
That's interesting.

238
00:23:49.129 --> 00:23:50.243
Mr. Pennyworth?

239
00:23:50.615 --> 00:23:51.604
Yes, Dory?

240
00:23:51.934 --> 00:23:53.377
The accountants are here.

241
00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.275
See them in, please, Dory.

242
00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:00.348
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

243
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:01.997
What do you mean?

244
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.895
What if this is the whole key?

245
00:24:04.801 --> 00:24:07.318
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

246
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.421
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

247
00:24:09.503 --> 00:24:10.658
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

248
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.844
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

249
00:24:12.927 --> 00:24:14.741
I don't see how that's gonna...

250
00:24:17.257 --> 00:24:18.247
Oh.

251
00:24:31.899 --> 00:24:33.548
Damn.

252
00:24:33.713 --> 00:24:35.940
Yeah, he's got a car.

253
00:24:36.848 --> 00:24:39.198
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

254
00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:40.931
Where to even start?

255
00:24:41.508 --> 00:24:43.817
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

256
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.890
You don't trust me?

257
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.538
You mean like you trust me?

258
00:24:47.621 --> 00:24:50.467
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

259
00:24:52.446 --> 00:24:53.560
There.

260
00:25:16.408 --> 00:25:17.687
What are we looking for?

261
00:25:18.306 --> 00:25:19.831
A USB port.

262
00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:21.028
USB?

263
00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:29.194
What?

264
00:25:34.514 --> 00:25:36.742
"Thumb" drive.

265
00:25:37.525 --> 00:25:39.134
Jesus.

266
00:25:42.721 --> 00:25:44.206
It's encrypted.

267
00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:48.867
Try this.

268
00:25:55.795 --> 00:25:58.146
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

269
00:26:06.931 --> 00:26:09.488
Oh, well, well, well.

270
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.127
So much for family values.

271
00:26:12.292 --> 00:26:13.447
Who is she?

272
00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:15.097
No idea.

273
00:26:16.004 --> 00:26:18.809
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

274
00:26:19.139 --> 00:26:20.623
I know who he is.

275
00:26:21.127 --> 00:26:22.117
What was that?

276
00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:26.654
Shit, shit! The drive.

277
00:26:27.446 --> 00:26:29.755
It sent out the photos from my account.

278
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:32.354
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

279
00:26:32.436 --> 00:26:34.499
Jesus.

280
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:36.932
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

281
00:26:37.014 --> 00:26:38.458
"He lies still."

282
00:26:38.664 --> 00:26:39.695
About her?

283
00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:42.500
Maybe.

284
00:26:42.665 --> 00:26:44.521
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

285
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.986
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

286
00:26:48.068 --> 00:26:50.171
Never get in there without a warrant.

287
00:26:52.481 --> 00:26:53.553
Yeah.

288
00:27:06.504 --> 00:27:07.699
Know who I am?

289
00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:11.246
Yeah. I got an idea.

290
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.102
I want to see the Penguin.

291
00:27:13.853 --> 00:27:16.080
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

292
00:27:21.401 --> 00:27:22.391
What's the problem?

293
00:27:22.473 --> 00:27:23.875
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

294
00:27:23.958 --> 00:27:26.102
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

295
00:27:26.185 --> 00:27:27.793
That's what I tried to tell him.

296
00:27:27.876 --> 00:27:30.144
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

297
00:27:30.227 --> 00:27:32.083
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

298
00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:34.516
Mine or yours?

299
00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:43.713
Get him!

300
00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:44.950
I saw that whole thing.

301
00:27:45.033 --> 00:27:46.229
He's over there!

302
00:27:46.311 --> 00:27:47.631
What is your problem?

303
00:28:29.873 --> 00:28:32.018
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

304
00:28:42.544 --> 00:28:43.946
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:28:44.069 --> 00:28:46.173
Take it easy, sweetheart.

306
00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:48.029
You looking for me?

307
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.626
I see you met the twins.

308
00:28:51.576 --> 00:28:54.834
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

309
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.184
I guess we both are.

310
00:28:59.256 --> 00:29:00.658
How you doing?

311
00:29:01.276 --> 00:29:02.679
I'm Oz.

312
00:29:08.164 --> 00:29:09.401
Who is she?

313
00:29:12.412 --> 00:29:14.309
I really don't know, chief.

314
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.196
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

315
00:29:17.278 --> 00:29:18.640
but I wasn't rolling with them.

316
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.910
It's okay, baby.

317
00:29:33.446 --> 00:29:37.198
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

318
00:30:02.646 --> 00:30:03.842
Thank you, honey.

319
00:30:10.276 --> 00:30:12.091
Here you go, champ.

320
00:30:12.173 --> 00:30:15.678
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

321
00:30:15.811 --> 00:30:17.584
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

322
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.440
Is that the mayor?

323
00:30:19.523 --> 00:30:21.296
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

324
00:30:22.493 --> 00:30:23.771
Don't make me hurt you.

325
00:30:23.853 --> 00:30:27.978
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

326
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.038
Yeah, I do. Do you?

327
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.256
Look...

328
00:30:35.493 --> 00:30:38.256
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

329
00:30:39.081 --> 00:30:43.329
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

330
00:30:51.577 --> 00:30:53.144
Tell you one thing.

331
00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:58.886
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

332
00:30:59.431 --> 00:31:01.906
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

333
00:31:05.122 --> 00:31:06.937
What? Too soon?

334
00:31:16.671 --> 00:31:19.022
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

335
00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:29.209
Taxi!

336
00:31:31.683 --> 00:31:32.673
Taxi!

337
00:31:51.232 --> 00:31:52.511
Hey, it's me.

338
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:55.109
Baby, what's wrong?

339
00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:57.749
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

340
00:32:00.182 --> 00:32:01.584
On the news?

341
00:32:02.244 --> 00:32:05.502
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

342
00:32:05.585 --> 00:32:07.276
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

343
00:32:08.431 --> 00:32:12.019
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

344
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.318
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

345
00:32:16.225 --> 00:32:17.380
Uh...

346
00:32:19.566 --> 00:32:20.885
God damn it.

347
00:32:40.642 --> 00:32:42.621
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

348
00:32:42.703 --> 00:32:44.559
<i>with a younger mystery woman.</i>

349
00:32:44.641 --> 00:32:47.447
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

350
00:33:20.623 --> 00:33:23.510
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

351
00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:36.639
You're pretty good at that.

352
00:36:07.818 --> 00:36:10.005
Hey! Give me that.

353
00:36:13.592 --> 00:36:16.108
"Kosolov, Annika."

354
00:36:17.243 --> 00:36:19.305
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

355
00:36:19.388 --> 00:36:22.110
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

356
00:36:59.264 --> 00:37:01.863
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

357
00:37:01.945 --> 00:37:04.378
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

358
00:37:04.461 --> 00:37:05.822
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

359
00:37:05.904 --> 00:37:07.637
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

360
00:37:07.719 --> 00:37:09.080
What does she know?

361
00:37:09.162 --> 00:37:11.266
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

362
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:12.916
She did seem upset.

363
00:37:14.689 --> 00:37:16.174
Back at your place.

364
00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:19.680
Let's go talk to her.

365
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.402
Anni!

366
00:37:47.681 --> 00:37:48.754
Baby!

367
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.393
Anni!

368
00:37:55.394 --> 00:37:56.631
Anni!

369
00:37:59.064 --> 00:38:00.425
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

370
00:38:00.507 --> 00:38:02.693
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

371
00:38:03.104 --> 00:38:04.507
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

372
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:09.748
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

373
00:38:09.868 --> 00:38:12.135
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>

374
00:38:12.218 --> 00:38:15.023
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

375
00:38:16.879 --> 00:38:18.611
Shit, they took my phone.

376
00:38:18.693 --> 00:38:20.054
<i>His victim, longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,</i>

377
00:38:20.137 --> 00:38:21.539
<i>Commissioner Pete Savage,</i>

378
00:38:21.621 --> 00:38:23.725
<i>was found dead earlier tonight</i>

379
00:38:23.807 --> 00:38:26.983
<i>inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.</i>

380
00:38:27.066 --> 00:38:30.242
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>

381
00:38:30.322 --> 00:38:33.168
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

382
00:38:38.075 --> 00:38:40.755
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

383
00:38:40.838 --> 00:38:42.776
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

384
00:38:44.262 --> 00:38:45.870
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

385
00:38:45.953 --> 00:38:50.695
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>

386
00:38:50.777 --> 00:38:52.798
<i>But I am not done.</i>

387
00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:58.078
<i>Here is another...</i>

388
00:39:02.532 --> 00:39:05.295
<i>who will soon be losing face.</i>

389
00:39:06.614 --> 00:39:10.583
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

390
00:39:10.738 --> 00:39:12.553
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

391
00:39:12.635 --> 00:39:17.584
<i>when the truth about our city</i>
<i>will finally...</i>

392
00:39:18.368 --> 00:39:20.348
<i>be unmasked.</i>

393
00:39:21.664 --> 00:39:23.397
<i>Goodbye!</i>

394
00:39:27.603 --> 00:39:29.212
<i>Commissioner Savage
served a distinguished</i>

395
00:39:29.294 --> 00:39:31.399
<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

396
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:33.667
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

397
00:39:35.028 --> 00:39:36.017
At the club.

398
00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:38.944
The Iceberg Lounge?

399
00:39:39.687 --> 00:39:41.130
44 Below.

400
00:39:43.027 --> 00:39:44.017
What is that?

401
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:48.635
The club within the club.

402
00:39:49.707 --> 00:39:51.605
The real club.

403
00:39:53.873 --> 00:39:55.606
It's a mob hangout.

404
00:39:56.058 --> 00:39:57.462
Is that where you work?

405
00:39:59.358 --> 00:40:00.183
Selina?

406
00:40:05.873 --> 00:40:07.729
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

407
00:40:11.153 --> 00:40:12.679
But I see 'em come in.

408
00:40:12.761 --> 00:40:13.957
Who?

409
00:40:14.535 --> 00:40:16.927
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

410
00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:21.008
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

411
00:40:23.236 --> 00:40:24.762
You're gonna help me on this.

412
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.865
For your friend.

413
00:40:37.216 --> 00:40:38.535
You got a lot of cats.

414
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.918
I have a thing about strays.

415
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:47.320
You're not safe here.

416
00:40:48.308 --> 00:40:49.463
I can take care of myself.

417
00:40:49.546 --> 00:40:52.309
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

418
00:40:52.392 --> 00:40:53.918
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

419
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.217
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

420
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.104
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

421
00:41:17.671 --> 00:41:20.806
He waited for him at the gym.

422
00:41:21.919 --> 00:41:23.940
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

423
00:41:24.022 --> 00:41:26.126
when no one else was around.

424
00:41:27.239 --> 00:41:28.642
There's a needle mark on his neck.

425
00:41:28.724 --> 00:41:30.662
Injected him with arsenic.

426
00:41:32.517 --> 00:41:33.837
Rat poison.

427
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.188
Yeah.

428
00:41:36.353 --> 00:41:38.786
That seems to be his theme here.

429
00:41:39.322 --> 00:41:40.683
Look at this thing.

430
00:41:48.726 --> 00:41:50.458
It's a maze.

431
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:56.148
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

432
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:59.942
More symbols.

433
00:42:02.292 --> 00:42:03.860
It's another cipher.

434
00:42:03.942 --> 00:42:06.664
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

435
00:42:07.323 --> 00:42:09.881
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

436
00:42:09.964 --> 00:42:13.057
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

437
00:42:14.624 --> 00:42:15.943
I don't get it.

438
00:42:16.026 --> 00:42:18.377
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

439
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.139
Looks like he got greedy.

440
00:42:21.221 --> 00:42:22.253
You kidding me?

441
00:42:22.335 --> 00:42:25.015
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

442
00:42:25.098 --> 00:42:28.315
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

443
00:42:28.397 --> 00:42:30.584
Maybe he's not who you thought.

444
00:42:31.984 --> 00:42:34.006
You make it sound like he had it coming.

445
00:42:36.232 --> 00:42:37.676
He was a cop.

446
00:42:38.996 --> 00:42:40.275
Crossed a line.

447
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:12.440
"I'm mad about you.

448
00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:16.152
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

449
00:43:23.204 --> 00:43:26.257
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

450
00:43:26.422 --> 00:43:29.969
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

451
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:31.742
The hell is that?

452
00:43:32.484 --> 00:43:35.619
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

453
00:43:36.607 --> 00:43:38.092
I don't know.

454
00:43:38.958 --> 00:43:40.113
Lieutenant.

455
00:43:40.195 --> 00:43:41.597
They're coming back.

456
00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.917
We got to get out of here.

457
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.155
Come on.

458
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:54.093
Ow!

459
00:43:55.536 --> 00:43:56.857
I don't know about these things.

460
00:43:56.939 --> 00:44:00.362
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

461
00:44:04.196 --> 00:44:06.753
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

462
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.052
I'm just looking for Annika.

463
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.909
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

464
00:44:16.898 --> 00:44:19.496
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

465
00:44:28.941 --> 00:44:30.137
Look at me.

466
00:44:39.539 --> 00:44:41.683
Looks good. Here.

467
00:45:23.995 --> 00:45:25.974
I got you. Can you hear me?

468
00:45:26.799 --> 00:45:27.789
Yeah.

469
00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:37.357
Hey, where you goin'?

470
00:45:37.975 --> 00:45:39.089
Hospitality.

471
00:45:39.831 --> 00:45:42.636
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

472
00:45:44.284 --> 00:45:45.768
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

473
00:45:52.243 --> 00:45:54.304
"Kenzie, William."

474
00:45:54.388 --> 00:45:55.830
He's an off-duty cop.

475
00:45:57.686 --> 00:45:59.337
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

476
00:45:59.666 --> 00:46:01.687
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

477
00:46:17.935 --> 00:46:21.029
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

478
00:46:21.112 --> 00:46:22.225
Great.

479
00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:31.669
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

480
00:46:31.752 --> 00:46:33.319
Feels good, doesn't it?

481
00:46:33.402 --> 00:46:35.587
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

482
00:46:41.443 --> 00:46:43.052
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

483
00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:44.165
Really?

484
00:46:44.247 --> 00:46:45.196
'Cause when I first saw you,

485
00:46:45.278 --> 00:46:46.475
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

486
00:46:46.557 --> 00:46:48.784
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

487
00:46:49.278 --> 00:46:51.010
Can we not do this right now?

488
00:46:52.907 --> 00:46:54.433
Wait. Who was that?

489
00:46:54.516 --> 00:46:55.671
Oh, I saw him.

490
00:46:55.753 --> 00:46:56.826
<i>Look back.</i>

491
00:46:56.908 --> 00:46:58.681
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

492
00:46:58.764 --> 00:47:00.083
I need to see his face.

493
00:47:01.608 --> 00:47:03.052
Jesus.

494
00:47:10.971 --> 00:47:12.125
That's the DA.

495
00:47:12.208 --> 00:47:13.239
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

496
00:47:13.321 --> 00:47:14.971
And he's coming over. You happy?

497
00:47:15.054 --> 00:47:16.249
<i>Talk to him.</i>

498
00:47:19.217 --> 00:47:20.290
Hey. How you doing?

499
00:47:20.372 --> 00:47:21.445
Hi.

500
00:47:21.527 --> 00:47:22.352
I'm Gil.

501
00:47:23.548 --> 00:47:25.156
Hey, aren't you the DA?

502
00:47:25.239 --> 00:47:26.188
Yeah.

503
00:47:26.394 --> 00:47:28.539
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

504
00:47:28.621 --> 00:47:29.982
Is that right?

505
00:47:30.269 --> 00:47:32.455
I haven't seen you around here before.

506
00:47:33.445 --> 00:47:35.466
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

507
00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:38.064
'cause people are all a little on edge.

508
00:47:38.147 --> 00:47:39.631
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

509
00:47:39.715 --> 00:47:40.704
<i>Is that right?</i>

510
00:47:40.993 --> 00:47:42.189
<i>I like that.</i>

511
00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.591
Do you want to come over?

512
00:47:43.674 --> 00:47:44.787
Sure.

513
00:47:47.632 --> 00:47:48.951
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

514
00:47:49.034 --> 00:47:50.436
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

515
00:47:50.725 --> 00:47:52.581
- <i>Richie, Glen.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

516
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.384
That's half the DA's office.

517
00:47:55.466 --> 00:47:56.621
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

518
00:47:56.704 --> 00:47:57.652
Hi.

519
00:47:57.734 --> 00:47:59.756
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

520
00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:01.694
Drowning our sorrows.

521
00:48:02.024 --> 00:48:03.303
<i>You want a drop?</i>

522
00:48:03.385 --> 00:48:05.406
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

523
00:48:07.219 --> 00:48:08.869
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

524
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:10.973
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

525
00:48:11.426 --> 00:48:12.375
He's wasted.

526
00:48:12.457 --> 00:48:13.488
No shit.

527
00:48:15.138 --> 00:48:16.127
<i>I like this girl.</i>

528
00:48:16.581 --> 00:48:18.149
Oh, hey, I like you too!

529
00:48:21.529 --> 00:48:24.829
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

530
00:48:24.911 --> 00:48:25.984
<i>He knows so much.</i>

531
00:48:26.066 --> 00:48:27.344
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

532
00:48:27.427 --> 00:48:29.654
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

533
00:48:29.736 --> 00:48:30.644
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

534
00:48:30.726 --> 00:48:32.624
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

535
00:48:32.706 --> 00:48:34.645
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

536
00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:38.439
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

537
00:48:48.543 --> 00:48:49.738
<i>I mean...</i>

538
00:48:50.563 --> 00:48:54.110
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

539
00:48:54.562 --> 00:48:56.954
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

540
00:48:57.037 --> 00:48:58.728
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

541
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.378
He's talking about the Maroni case.

542
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.718
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

543
00:49:04.171 --> 00:49:06.439
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

544
00:49:06.522 --> 00:49:08.419
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

545
00:49:08.502 --> 00:49:11.099
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

546
00:49:11.182 --> 00:49:12.419
What do you know about that?

547
00:49:14.028 --> 00:49:15.182
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

548
00:49:15.265 --> 00:49:16.214
<i>I want a drink.</i>

549
00:49:16.379 --> 00:49:17.616
Keep him talking.

550
00:49:20.543 --> 00:49:21.615
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

551
00:49:21.697 --> 00:49:22.729
She knows Annika.

552
00:49:22.812 --> 00:49:24.214
No, stay on the DA.

553
00:49:24.296 --> 00:49:26.194
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

554
00:49:28.172 --> 00:49:30.275
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

555
00:49:30.357 --> 00:49:31.389
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

556
00:49:31.471 --> 00:49:33.987
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

557
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:35.306
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

558
00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:37.823
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

559
00:49:37.905 --> 00:49:40.792
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

560
00:49:40.875 --> 00:49:42.359
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

561
00:49:42.442 --> 00:49:43.514
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

562
00:49:48.216 --> 00:49:49.247
<i>Hey.</i>

563
00:49:49.825 --> 00:49:50.896
Hey.

564
00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:55.186
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

565
00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.535
How you been?

566
00:49:59.845 --> 00:50:01.536
Yeah, I've been okay.

567
00:50:02.856 --> 00:50:04.217
<i>I was just...</i>

568
00:50:06.113 --> 00:50:07.927
I was just headed back upstairs.

569
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.660
Well...

570
00:50:10.732 --> 00:50:12.381
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

571
00:50:26.197 --> 00:50:28.547
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

572
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.198
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

573
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.053
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

574
00:50:32.136 --> 00:50:33.950
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

575
00:50:34.032 --> 00:50:35.105
Wait, what are you doing?

576
00:50:35.187 --> 00:50:37.579
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

577
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:42.981
Taxi!

578
00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:47.890
Hey!

579
00:50:49.456 --> 00:50:50.527
I lost you in there.

580
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.682
Yeah, I gotta go.

581
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:53.951
Oh, you need a ride?

582
00:50:54.652 --> 00:50:55.931
That's me right there.

583
00:51:01.827 --> 00:51:02.899
Taxi!

584
00:51:02.982 --> 00:51:04.095
I'm good.

585
00:51:05.786 --> 00:51:07.188
I hope, uh...

586
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.002
I'll see you around.

587
00:52:37.955 --> 00:52:41.709
Just hold still.

588
00:53:38.657 --> 00:53:39.564
What do you know about

589
00:53:39.647 --> 00:53:41.916
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

590
00:53:45.217 --> 00:53:46.908
Yeah, sure, there was.

591
00:53:47.609 --> 00:53:49.424
That's the rat we're looking for.

592
00:53:50.332 --> 00:53:52.188
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

593
00:53:52.765 --> 00:53:55.735
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

594
00:53:55.817 --> 00:53:57.260
Where are you getting this?

595
00:53:57.342 --> 00:54:00.188
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

596
00:54:00.847 --> 00:54:02.291
Gil's very nervous.

597
00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:05.755
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

598
00:54:05.837 --> 00:54:07.693
I worked that case.

599
00:54:07.776 --> 00:54:09.714
Riddler's not after you.

600
00:54:09.796 --> 00:54:10.704
How do you know?

601
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:12.353
You're not corrupt.

602
00:54:13.384 --> 00:54:14.909
Colson's dirty?

603
00:54:20.725 --> 00:54:22.210
Maybe I, uh...

604
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:26.169
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

605
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:29.510
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

606
00:54:30.127 --> 00:54:31.900
Who knows how many people it touches.

607
00:54:31.983 --> 00:54:35.158
Politicians. Police. The courts.

608
00:54:36.437 --> 00:54:38.128
It could tear the whole city apart.

609
00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.561
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

610
00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:43.778
And Riddler's the match.

611
00:54:44.643 --> 00:54:45.798
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

612
00:54:45.881 --> 00:54:47.160
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

613
00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:48.644
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

614
00:54:48.727 --> 00:54:50.211
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

615
00:54:51.243 --> 00:54:52.810
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

616
00:54:52.892 --> 00:54:54.541
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

617
00:54:55.656 --> 00:54:57.098
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

618
00:54:57.182 --> 00:54:58.213
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

619
00:54:58.295 --> 00:54:59.904
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

620
00:54:59.986 --> 00:55:01.800
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

621
00:55:01.883 --> 00:55:03.120
Pretty.

622
00:55:04.975 --> 00:55:06.336
She a new friend of yours?

623
00:55:10.748 --> 00:55:11.944
I'm not so sure.

624
00:55:12.769 --> 00:55:14.253
Looks like you upset her.

625
00:55:15.408 --> 00:55:17.511
Shall I take this as a good sign?

626
00:55:17.594 --> 00:55:18.584
What?

627
00:55:18.666 --> 00:55:19.574
Your attire.

628
00:55:19.656 --> 00:55:21.759
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

629
00:55:21.842 --> 00:55:23.822
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

630
00:55:23.904 --> 00:55:26.543
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

631
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:29.017
Riddler might not be able to resist.

632
00:55:29.099 --> 00:55:30.543
Oh, that reminds me.

633
00:55:31.698 --> 00:55:35.616
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

634
00:55:36.027 --> 00:55:37.512
The one from the rat maze.

635
00:55:37.924 --> 00:55:40.977
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

636
00:55:41.306 --> 00:55:43.162
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

637
00:55:43.245 --> 00:55:46.462
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

638
00:55:46.955 --> 00:55:48.358
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

639
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.636
"Rat with wings"?

640
00:55:49.719 --> 00:55:52.193
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

641
00:55:52.276 --> 00:55:53.513
Yeah.

642
00:55:54.956 --> 00:55:56.070
A stool pigeon.

643
00:55:56.317 --> 00:55:57.926
Where are your cufflinks?

644
00:55:58.008 --> 00:55:58.957
I couldn't find them.

645
00:56:00.275 --> 00:56:02.214
Well, you can't go out like that.

646
00:56:02.296 --> 00:56:04.070
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

647
00:56:08.194 --> 00:56:10.957
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

648
00:56:12.648 --> 00:56:14.834
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

649
00:56:15.824 --> 00:56:17.598
Your father gave them to me.

650
00:56:23.164 --> 00:56:26.257
No more lies! No more lies!

651
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.167
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

652
00:56:59.331 --> 00:57:01.064
Is that Bruce Wayne?

653
00:57:01.146 --> 00:57:03.745
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

654
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.600
Hold it.

655
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:16.157
You good, fellas?

656
00:57:16.735 --> 00:57:17.724
Good.

657
00:57:19.703 --> 00:57:20.776
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

658
00:57:38.386 --> 00:57:39.376
Sir?

659
00:57:58.593 --> 00:57:59.541
Hey!

660
00:57:59.623 --> 00:58:01.603
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

661
00:58:02.552 --> 00:58:04.367
Hey, watch it, fellas.

662
00:58:04.821 --> 00:58:07.088
You got the prince of the city there.

663
00:58:09.768 --> 00:58:11.583
Some event, huh?

664
00:58:11.665 --> 00:58:14.594
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

665
00:58:14.676 --> 00:58:17.110
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

666
00:58:17.192 --> 00:58:18.801
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

667
00:58:18.883 --> 00:58:20.862
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

668
00:58:21.603 --> 00:58:23.006
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

669
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:25.068
Wow. Is that right?

670
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:27.172
His father saved my life.

671
00:58:27.995 --> 00:58:31.171
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

672
00:58:32.367 --> 00:58:35.832
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

673
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.046
Operated right on the dining room table.

674
00:58:39.253 --> 00:58:44.450
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

675
00:58:45.852 --> 00:58:47.832
I remember your face.

676
00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:51.749
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

677
00:58:52.121 --> 00:58:54.225
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

678
00:58:55.544 --> 00:58:57.111
"Hippocratic oath."

679
00:58:59.627 --> 00:59:00.823
That's good.

680
00:59:01.234 --> 00:59:02.389
Excuse me.

681
00:59:05.936 --> 00:59:06.761
Yes.

682
00:59:20.658 --> 00:59:21.730
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

683
00:59:21.813 --> 00:59:23.381
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

684
00:59:23.463 --> 00:59:25.814
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

685
00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:27.669
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

686
00:59:27.752 --> 00:59:29.155
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

687
00:59:29.237 --> 00:59:30.639
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

688
00:59:30.722 --> 00:59:32.124
<i>consider a donation to</i>

689
00:59:32.206 --> 00:59:34.227
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

690
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:36.537
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

691
00:59:36.619 --> 00:59:37.816
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

692
00:59:38.062 --> 00:59:40.577
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

693
00:59:41.525 --> 00:59:45.236
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

694
00:59:45.319 --> 00:59:48.494
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

695
00:59:49.484 --> 00:59:51.340
He got what he deserved.

696
00:59:53.238 --> 00:59:54.228
Know what I mean?

697
00:59:55.381 --> 00:59:57.485
Hey, don't I know you?

698
00:59:57.567 --> 00:59:58.640
Bruce Wayne.

699
00:59:59.546 --> 01:00:01.485
Why haven't you called me back?

700
01:00:01.568 --> 01:00:02.557
I'm sorry?

701
01:00:02.846 --> 01:00:05.156
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

702
01:00:05.238 --> 01:00:06.435
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

703
01:00:06.517 --> 01:00:09.156
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

704
01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:10.558
Will you walk with me?

705
01:00:15.547 --> 01:00:16.867
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:18.146
Mr. Wayne.

707
01:00:18.847 --> 01:00:21.899
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

708
01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:24.167
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

709
01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:26.641
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

710
01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:29.156
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

711
01:00:29.734 --> 01:00:31.012
Thank you.

712
01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:32.869
My God.

713
01:00:34.558 --> 01:00:37.033
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

714
01:00:37.115 --> 01:00:38.724
I want to continue this.

715
01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:43.755
Excuse me.

716
01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:47.507
I'm so sorry for your loss.

717
01:00:49.693 --> 01:00:50.601
Thank you.

718
01:00:50.683 --> 01:00:52.415
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

719
01:00:53.735 --> 01:00:55.591
Gil Colson is missing.

720
01:00:55.673 --> 01:00:56.952
What?

721
01:00:57.034 --> 01:00:59.302
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

722
01:00:59.385 --> 01:01:00.416
Christ, not again.

723
01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:02.561
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

724
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.850
You got people looking for him, Jim?

725
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:09.778
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

726
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:10.768
What'd his wife say?

727
01:01:10.851 --> 01:01:12.047
She hadn't heard from him.

728
01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:06.731
Get out of the car!

729
01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:09.659
Get out of the car and show your hands!

730
01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.258
Get out!

731
01:02:22.526 --> 01:02:23.804
Get 'em up!

732
01:02:23.887 --> 01:02:25.619
Get out! Show 'em!

733
01:02:30.032 --> 01:02:31.599
Christ, it's Colson.

734
01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:33.373
There's a bomb around his neck!

735
01:02:48.261 --> 01:02:49.788
Let's clear this place out now!

736
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:51.479
We've got to get this place cleared out!

737
01:03:25.339 --> 01:03:28.061
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

738
01:03:31.031 --> 01:03:32.433
We don't know if he's in on it.

739
01:03:35.526 --> 01:03:36.846
What's he looking at?

740
01:03:55.405 --> 01:03:56.725
Holy shit.

741
01:03:57.756 --> 01:03:59.405
Are you kidding me?

742
01:03:59.488 --> 01:04:02.210
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

743
01:04:03.035 --> 01:04:05.468
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

744
01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:22.254
Please.

745
01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.141
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

746
01:04:25.553 --> 01:04:27.740
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

747
01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:28.811
I'm so sorry.

748
01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:31.081
Looks like a combination lock.

749
01:04:31.164 --> 01:04:32.607
Can't we just cut it off?

750
01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:34.999
Not if you want to keep your head.

751
01:05:11.294 --> 01:05:12.531
<i>You came.</i>

752
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:15.543
Who are you?

753
01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.069
<i>Me?</i>

754
01:05:19.461 --> 01:05:21.028
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

755
01:05:22.472 --> 01:05:24.864
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

756
01:05:24.946 --> 01:05:29.194
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

757
01:05:29.855 --> 01:05:30.928
"Unmask"?

758
01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.165
<i>Yes.</i>

759
01:05:32.989 --> 01:05:35.794
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

760
01:05:35.877 --> 01:05:38.269
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

761
01:05:38.928 --> 01:05:41.238
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

762
01:05:41.445 --> 01:05:43.219
How am I a part of this?

763
01:05:43.302 --> 01:05:45.199
<i>You'll see.</i>

764
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:47.014
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

765
01:05:47.096 --> 01:05:49.158
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

766
01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:50.478
<i>We're live.</i>

767
01:05:50.561 --> 01:05:53.530
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

768
01:05:54.726 --> 01:05:55.881
<i>At the moment,</i>

769
01:05:55.964 --> 01:05:59.304
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

770
01:05:59.386 --> 01:06:00.417
<i>is dead.</i>

771
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.480
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

772
01:06:02.562 --> 01:06:03.510
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

773
01:06:03.594 --> 01:06:06.687
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

774
01:06:06.769 --> 01:06:09.738
<i>You hear me?</i>

775
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:10.811
Okay.

776
01:06:19.471 --> 01:06:21.534
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

777
01:06:23.267 --> 01:06:25.410
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

778
01:06:27.432 --> 01:06:28.463
<i>Now,</i>

779
01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:32.216
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

780
01:06:32.299 --> 01:06:35.846
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

781
01:06:36.423 --> 01:06:38.815
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

782
01:06:38.897 --> 01:06:42.197
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

783
01:06:42.279 --> 01:06:47.435
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

784
01:06:47.517 --> 01:06:49.744
You want me to do puzzles?

785
01:06:49.827 --> 01:06:52.549
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

786
01:06:52.631 --> 01:06:56.673
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

787
01:06:56.756 --> 01:06:59.065
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

788
01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.292
Okay, okay. So I just...

789
01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:02.447
You want me to...

790
01:07:02.571 --> 01:07:04.880
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

791
01:07:04.963 --> 01:07:08.551
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

792
01:07:08.634 --> 01:07:13.252
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

793
01:07:13.336 --> 01:07:15.728
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

794
01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:16.882
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

795
01:07:16.965 --> 01:07:18.367
- "Justice."
- Huh?

796
01:07:18.449 --> 01:07:19.480
The answer's "justice."

797
01:07:19.563 --> 01:07:20.759
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

798
01:07:20.841 --> 01:07:22.408
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

799
01:07:22.491 --> 01:07:26.780
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

800
01:07:26.863 --> 01:07:29.213
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

801
01:07:29.296 --> 01:07:31.647
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

802
01:07:31.729 --> 01:07:32.925
Of course, of course. Of course.

803
01:07:33.008 --> 01:07:35.359
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

804
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:39.524
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

805
01:07:39.607 --> 01:07:43.732
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

806
01:07:43.814 --> 01:07:45.587
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

807
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:46.907
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

808
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:49.134
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

809
01:07:50.536 --> 01:07:51.650
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

810
01:07:51.732 --> 01:07:52.969
- How much?
- Nothing!

811
01:07:53.052 --> 01:07:55.238
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

812
01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.589
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

813
01:07:57.671 --> 01:07:58.496
What cases?

814
01:07:58.579 --> 01:07:59.692
He didn't ask me that!

815
01:07:59.774 --> 01:08:00.764
Come on! Ten grand.

816
01:08:01.218 --> 01:08:04.146
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

817
01:08:04.229 --> 01:08:06.827
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

818
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:10.704
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

819
01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:13.178
<i>Last riddle.</i>

820
01:08:13.261 --> 01:08:17.550
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

821
01:08:17.758 --> 01:08:22.006
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

822
01:08:22.088 --> 01:08:24.151
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

823
01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.748
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

824
01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:28.605
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

825
01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:29.883
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

826
01:08:29.966 --> 01:08:31.616
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

827
01:08:31.698 --> 01:08:33.637
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

828
01:08:33.719 --> 01:08:35.245
If I go out this way, it's just me.

829
01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:38.421
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

830
01:08:38.503 --> 01:08:39.947
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

831
01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:41.349
- People are watching.
- What people?

832
01:08:41.432 --> 01:08:43.535
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

833
01:08:43.617 --> 01:08:45.762
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

834
01:08:45.844 --> 01:08:46.710
<i>Four!</i>

835
01:08:46.793 --> 01:08:48.154
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

836
01:08:48.236 --> 01:08:50.092
<i>Goodbye!</i>

837
01:09:20.077 --> 01:09:21.439
Who do you think he is under there?

838
01:09:21.521 --> 01:09:22.346
Take it easy.

839
01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:23.418
I want to see.

840
01:09:24.738 --> 01:09:25.934
What is that thing? Leather?

841
01:09:29.645 --> 01:09:31.089
What's he got on his eyes?

842
01:09:31.172 --> 01:09:32.615
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

843
01:09:32.698 --> 01:09:33.893
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

844
01:09:33.976 --> 01:09:35.131
Hey!

845
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:38.802
Hey! Hey! Hey!

846
01:09:38.884 --> 01:09:40.533
Relax, God damn it!

847
01:09:40.616 --> 01:09:42.101
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

848
01:09:43.378 --> 01:09:45.894
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

849
01:09:45.976 --> 01:09:48.368
Colson's blood is on his hands.

850
01:09:48.452 --> 01:09:49.854
Maybe it's on yours.

851
01:09:51.296 --> 01:09:52.328
What'd you say?

852
01:09:52.411 --> 01:09:53.978
He would rather die than talk.

853
01:09:54.555 --> 01:09:56.040
What was he afraid of?

854
01:09:56.782 --> 01:09:57.854
You?

855
01:10:04.907 --> 01:10:06.309
You son of a bitch.

856
01:10:06.886 --> 01:10:09.856
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

857
01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:11.630
You could be an accessory to murder.

858
01:10:11.712 --> 01:10:12.702
Why are we playing games...

859
01:10:14.805 --> 01:10:15.671
Get him! Come on!

860
01:10:15.754 --> 01:10:17.734
Back off! Back off!

861
01:10:17.816 --> 01:10:20.085
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

862
01:10:20.167 --> 01:10:22.229
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

863
01:10:22.311 --> 01:10:25.075
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

864
01:10:27.839 --> 01:10:29.365
You too now?

865
01:10:29.448 --> 01:10:31.964
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

866
01:10:32.046 --> 01:10:34.603
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

867
01:10:34.686 --> 01:10:36.913
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

868
01:10:39.676 --> 01:10:41.161
Okay, give him the room.

869
01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:57.905
Two minutes.

870
01:11:09.536 --> 01:11:11.103
You listen to me.

871
01:11:12.671 --> 01:11:14.650
We gotta get you out of here.

872
01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.239
That would put a lot of heat on you.

873
01:11:18.321 --> 01:11:19.970
Well, you punched me in the face.

874
01:11:22.198 --> 01:11:23.477
Take this key.

875
01:11:24.755 --> 01:11:28.095
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

876
01:11:29.127 --> 01:11:30.818
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

877
01:11:31.808 --> 01:11:34.076
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

878
01:11:37.541 --> 01:11:39.892
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

879
01:11:43.274 --> 01:11:45.955
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

880
01:11:46.037 --> 01:11:48.925
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

881
01:11:49.832 --> 01:11:52.430
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

882
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:57.049
Or he moonlights as a cop.

883
01:12:01.586 --> 01:12:03.071
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

884
01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:04.638
Somebody stop him!

885
01:12:42.416 --> 01:12:43.943
- There he is!
- Freeze!

886
01:13:29.804 --> 01:13:31.702
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

887
01:13:32.238 --> 01:13:33.434
I did.

888
01:13:33.517 --> 01:13:36.857
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

889
01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:38.960
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

890
01:13:39.043 --> 01:13:40.157
I only trust you.

891
01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:42.549
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

892
01:13:42.632 --> 01:13:45.972
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

893
01:13:46.715 --> 01:13:47.828
You think Penguin's the rat?

894
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:50.921
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

895
01:13:51.128 --> 01:13:53.067
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

896
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:54.469
DA was a regular too.

897
01:13:54.552 --> 01:13:58.016
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

898
01:13:59.088 --> 01:14:00.285
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

899
01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:01.315
The what?

900
01:14:01.398 --> 01:14:02.841
Riddler's latest.

901
01:14:02.924 --> 01:14:04.615
The cipher in the maze.

902
01:14:04.697 --> 01:14:07.172
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

903
01:14:08.739 --> 01:14:10.347
A penguin's got wings too.

904
01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:14.266
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

905
01:14:14.348 --> 01:14:15.998
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

906
01:14:16.081 --> 01:14:19.256
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

907
01:14:19.464 --> 01:14:22.598
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

908
01:14:25.196 --> 01:14:27.011
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

909
01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:29.239
There's Penguin.

910
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:31.177
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

911
01:14:32.786 --> 01:14:34.023
<i>You want to move in?</i>

912
01:14:35.879 --> 01:14:37.322
<i>Let's follow.</i>

913
01:14:55.634 --> 01:14:59.139
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

914
01:14:59.263 --> 01:15:00.501
<i>I'm here.</i>

915
01:15:01.903 --> 01:15:03.552
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

916
01:15:03.635 --> 01:15:06.109
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

917
01:15:25.123 --> 01:15:27.639
It's a drug lab. Drops.

918
01:15:27.721 --> 01:15:28.917
This is a buy.

919
01:15:28.999 --> 01:15:32.134
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

920
01:15:32.216 --> 01:15:33.371
Or they never shut it down at all.

921
01:15:33.454 --> 01:15:34.320
<i>What are you saying?</i>

922
01:15:34.402 --> 01:15:37.495
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

923
01:16:01.581 --> 01:16:02.984
This just got complicated.

924
01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:04.880
What do you mean?

925
01:16:10.737 --> 01:16:12.181
Hey! What happened?

926
01:16:12.263 --> 01:16:13.583
You all right?

927
01:16:24.182 --> 01:16:25.955
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

928
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.688
Jesus.

929
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:30.245
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

930
01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.060
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

931
01:16:32.143 --> 01:16:33.834
Is that why you work in the club?

932
01:16:34.575 --> 01:16:35.607
It was all just a score?

933
01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:39.442
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

934
01:16:40.803 --> 01:16:42.700
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

935
01:16:53.877 --> 01:16:54.826
Jesus!

936
01:17:23.118 --> 01:17:24.232
Hey, Vengeance!

937
01:17:26.377 --> 01:17:29.057
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

938
01:18:09.475 --> 01:18:11.084
Kenzie! Get the money!

939
01:18:16.446 --> 01:18:17.683
Hey! What the...

940
01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:09.197
Whoa!

941
01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:13.940
Come on! Come on!

942
01:19:17.074 --> 01:19:18.394
This guy's crazy!

943
01:19:20.126 --> 01:19:21.817
Come on! Hey!

944
01:20:10.731 --> 01:20:11.721
Move!

945
01:21:16.063 --> 01:21:17.919
Get out of the way!

946
01:21:29.056 --> 01:21:30.128
Come on!

947
01:21:38.747 --> 01:21:39.861
Get out of the way!

948
01:22:16.816 --> 01:22:18.837
I got you!

949
01:22:20.074 --> 01:22:21.394
I got you!

950
01:22:21.477 --> 01:22:23.786
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

951
01:22:23.869 --> 01:22:25.312
I got you!

952
01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:43.065
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

953
01:23:43.148 --> 01:23:45.746
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

954
01:23:45.828 --> 01:23:47.107
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

955
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:48.591
Cops caught you doing something.

956
01:23:48.674 --> 01:23:50.282
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

957
01:23:50.365 --> 01:23:52.221
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

958
01:23:52.303 --> 01:23:54.406
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

959
01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:55.685
His drops operation.

960
01:23:55.768 --> 01:23:58.201
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

961
01:23:58.284 --> 01:24:01.872
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

962
01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:03.687
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

963
01:24:03.769 --> 01:24:06.079
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

964
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:09.337
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

965
01:24:09.419 --> 01:24:10.574
What are you, crazy?

966
01:24:10.656 --> 01:24:11.729
That why you killed the girl?

967
01:24:11.811 --> 01:24:12.760
I didn't kill no girl!

968
01:24:12.842 --> 01:24:14.615
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

969
01:24:14.699 --> 01:24:15.977
But she got too close, right?

970
01:24:16.059 --> 01:24:18.245
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

971
01:24:18.328 --> 01:24:20.266
But somehow Riddler found out too.

972
01:24:20.349 --> 01:24:22.245
He knows so much about you.

973
01:24:22.328 --> 01:24:24.350
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

974
01:24:24.927 --> 01:24:27.112
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

975
01:24:27.525 --> 01:24:28.680
Why don't you start harmonizing?

976
01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:31.649
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

977
01:24:31.731 --> 01:24:33.051
I ain't no rat!

978
01:24:33.133 --> 01:24:34.949
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

979
01:24:35.031 --> 01:24:36.103
if he heard this kind of talk?

980
01:24:36.186 --> 01:24:38.331
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

981
01:24:38.413 --> 01:24:40.929
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

982
01:24:41.012 --> 01:24:42.537
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

983
01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:44.228
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

984
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:46.208
Open your eyes!

985
01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.652
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

986
01:24:51.735 --> 01:24:53.219
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

987
01:24:53.302 --> 01:24:55.116
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

988
01:24:55.198 --> 01:24:57.508
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

989
01:24:57.591 --> 01:25:00.148
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

990
01:25:00.356 --> 01:25:01.716
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

991
01:25:01.799 --> 01:25:02.995
Why, you got something to tell us?

992
01:25:03.078 --> 01:25:03.944
Yeah!

993
01:25:04.604 --> 01:25:05.635
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

994
01:25:05.717 --> 01:25:06.542
What?

995
01:25:06.954 --> 01:25:08.274
It's <i>"La."</i>

996
01:25:08.356 --> 01:25:09.635
<i>"La" rata.</i>

997
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:12.110
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

998
01:25:12.192 --> 01:25:14.048
Jesus! Look at you two.

999
01:25:14.461 --> 01:25:16.687
World's greatest detectives!

1000
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.368
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

1001
01:25:19.451 --> 01:25:20.523
Jesus!

1002
01:25:20.606 --> 01:25:22.090
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

1003
01:25:22.173 --> 01:25:24.153
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1004
01:25:25.555 --> 01:25:26.627
You think he made a mistake?

1005
01:25:26.710 --> 01:25:27.906
He doesn't make mistakes.

1006
01:25:27.988 --> 01:25:29.019
A rat with wings?

1007
01:25:29.102 --> 01:25:30.670
You know what that sounds like to me?

1008
01:25:30.752 --> 01:25:33.886
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1009
01:25:33.968 --> 01:25:35.948
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1010
01:25:41.516 --> 01:25:45.352
"You are <i>el."</i>

1011
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:55.415
Maybe it was a mistake.

1012
01:25:55.828 --> 01:25:56.652
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1013
01:25:56.734 --> 01:25:57.559
Wait.

1014
01:26:00.941 --> 01:26:02.261
Is that him?

1015
01:26:03.127 --> 01:26:04.942
Holy shit.

1016
01:26:24.615 --> 01:26:26.182
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1017
01:26:55.383 --> 01:26:58.972
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1018
01:26:59.054 --> 01:27:01.859
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1019
01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:03.839
I'll never know where I come from.

1020
01:27:04.704 --> 01:27:06.024
Do you know what I am?"

1021
01:27:06.107 --> 01:27:07.097
Any idea?

1022
01:27:07.633 --> 01:27:08.623
Yeah.

1023
01:27:10.025 --> 01:27:11.262
It's an orphan.

1024
01:27:20.047 --> 01:27:21.779
A mansion in a slum.

1025
01:27:23.305 --> 01:27:25.862
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1026
01:27:25.944 --> 01:27:27.635
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1027
01:27:28.504 --> 01:27:30.577
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1028
01:27:30.668 --> 01:27:31.493
Let's go.

1029
01:27:34.071 --> 01:27:36.504
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1030
01:27:37.535 --> 01:27:38.896
You gonna untie me?

1031
01:27:38.978 --> 01:27:40.422
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1032
01:27:44.298 --> 01:27:45.288
Hey!

1033
01:27:46.732 --> 01:27:49.124
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1034
01:28:03.065 --> 01:28:05.209
No guns.

1035
01:28:06.527 --> 01:28:08.548
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1036
01:28:29.418 --> 01:28:30.613
What's that?

1037
01:28:41.007 --> 01:28:42.904
Hey! Hey!

1038
01:28:49.297 --> 01:28:50.492
Dropheads.

1039
01:28:57.834 --> 01:28:59.442
What the hell is that?

1040
01:29:11.198 --> 01:29:13.548
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1041
01:29:13.631 --> 01:29:14.910
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1042
01:29:17.631 --> 01:29:19.652
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

1043
01:29:20.065 --> 01:29:21.632
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1044
01:29:23.365 --> 01:29:24.932
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1045
01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:27.983
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1046
01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:32.603
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

1047
01:29:33.139 --> 01:29:34.912
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1048
01:29:34.995 --> 01:29:37.800
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

1049
01:29:37.882 --> 01:29:41.181
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1050
01:29:41.717 --> 01:29:43.573
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1051
01:29:43.656 --> 01:29:46.419
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

1052
01:29:46.873 --> 01:29:49.678
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

1053
01:29:50.255 --> 01:29:54.256
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

1054
01:29:54.338 --> 01:29:56.236
<i>who need it now,</i>

1055
01:29:56.443 --> 01:29:57.886
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1056
01:29:57.968 --> 01:29:59.371
"Sins of the father."

1057
01:29:59.454 --> 01:30:01.886
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

1058
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.382
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1059
01:30:10.218 --> 01:30:12.404
Shall be visited upon the son.

1060
01:30:14.383 --> 01:30:17.476
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1061
01:30:22.013 --> 01:30:23.415
Hey!

1062
01:31:22.434 --> 01:31:24.950
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1063
01:31:25.033 --> 01:31:26.847
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

1064
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:28.538
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1065
01:31:29.198 --> 01:31:31.260
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1066
01:31:42.932 --> 01:31:44.664
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1067
01:31:45.819 --> 01:31:47.469
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:31:48.912 --> 01:31:50.644
I've been trying to reach you.

1069
01:31:53.366 --> 01:31:55.016
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1070
01:31:55.553 --> 01:31:59.264
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1071
01:32:21.742 --> 01:32:23.350
We've sedated him.

1072
01:32:23.433 --> 01:32:25.041
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1073
01:32:26.032 --> 01:32:28.713
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1074
01:32:29.249 --> 01:32:30.981
Is there anyone else to notify?

1075
01:32:32.301 --> 01:32:33.703
Next of kin?

1076
01:32:38.776 --> 01:32:39.848
No.

1077
01:32:40.963 --> 01:32:42.570
It's just me.

1078
01:34:24.648 --> 01:34:25.885
Selina?

1079
01:34:32.443 --> 01:34:33.433
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1080
01:34:36.526 --> 01:34:38.918
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1081
01:34:39.909 --> 01:34:40.982
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1082
01:34:59.458 --> 01:35:01.356
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1083
01:35:02.428 --> 01:35:04.861
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1084
01:35:04.944 --> 01:35:07.377
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1085
01:35:08.037 --> 01:35:09.769
How could they do that to her?

1086
01:35:09.851 --> 01:35:11.790
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1087
01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:13.770
Her body was in his car.

1088
01:35:13.852 --> 01:35:16.698
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1089
01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.749
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1090
01:35:19.833 --> 01:35:21.358
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1091
01:35:21.441 --> 01:35:23.049
She didn't know any better.

1092
01:35:23.132 --> 01:35:24.451
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1093
01:35:24.534 --> 01:35:26.060
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1094
01:35:26.142 --> 01:35:27.628
It means your choices have consequences.

1095
01:35:27.710 --> 01:35:30.061
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1096
01:35:30.143 --> 01:35:32.824
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1097
01:35:32.906 --> 01:35:34.722
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1098
01:35:35.051 --> 01:35:37.196
Compromising yourself for money?

1099
01:35:38.432 --> 01:35:40.659
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1100
01:35:42.017 --> 01:35:45.647
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1101
01:35:45.729 --> 01:35:47.049
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1102
01:35:47.131 --> 01:35:48.451
Falcone owes me that money.

1103
01:35:48.533 --> 01:35:50.266
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1104
01:35:50.348 --> 01:35:51.174
Oh, really? Why's that?

1105
01:35:51.256 --> 01:35:52.163
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1106
01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:53.978
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1107
01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:55.050
would owe you anything.

1108
01:35:55.133 --> 01:35:57.442
Because he's my father!

1109
01:36:06.349 --> 01:36:09.113
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1110
01:36:10.472 --> 01:36:11.751
Just like Anni.

1111
01:36:13.895 --> 01:36:16.411
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1112
01:36:18.349 --> 01:36:19.669
To the club?

1113
01:36:20.576 --> 01:36:21.565
Yeah.

1114
01:36:24.246 --> 01:36:27.092
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1115
01:36:27.546 --> 01:36:29.278
Used to see him there.

1116
01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:32.000
He scared the shit out of me.

1117
01:36:33.939 --> 01:36:37.361
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1118
01:36:37.773 --> 01:36:41.567
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1119
01:36:44.908 --> 01:36:47.218
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1120
01:36:47.752 --> 01:36:49.237
Strangled.

1121
01:36:49.650 --> 01:36:53.073
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1122
01:36:54.928 --> 01:36:56.991
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1123
01:36:57.073 --> 01:36:59.218
and he didn't say a thing.

1124
01:37:00.907 --> 01:37:02.681
Couldn't even look at me.

1125
01:37:06.392 --> 01:37:08.125
He owes me that money.

1126
01:37:09.899 --> 01:37:11.301
I'm sorry.

1127
01:37:12.414 --> 01:37:13.569
For what I said.

1128
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:16.332
Oh, it's all right.

1129
01:37:19.838 --> 01:37:21.900
You assume the worst in people.

1130
01:37:22.682 --> 01:37:24.044
Which, well...

1131
01:37:26.312 --> 01:37:28.209
maybe we're not so different after all.

1132
01:37:33.612 --> 01:37:35.344
Who are you under there?

1133
01:37:41.365 --> 01:37:43.221
What are you hiding?

1134
01:37:45.448 --> 01:37:47.262
Are you just...

1135
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:50.521
hideously scarred?

1136
01:37:52.624 --> 01:37:53.614
Yeah.

1137
01:38:00.665 --> 01:38:02.067
Listen to me.

1138
01:38:03.593 --> 01:38:06.438
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1139
01:38:07.468 --> 01:38:12.087
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1140
01:38:12.706 --> 01:38:15.758
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1141
01:38:15.841 --> 01:38:17.078
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1142
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:18.398
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1143
01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.501
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1144
01:38:20.583 --> 01:38:21.821
I think you'd be on his side.

1145
01:38:21.904 --> 01:38:23.512
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1146
01:38:23.594 --> 01:38:25.533
What, do you live in a cave?

1147
01:38:25.616 --> 01:38:27.677
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1148
01:38:28.625 --> 01:38:32.460
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1149
01:38:32.543 --> 01:38:33.739
will you help me?

1150
01:38:34.852 --> 01:38:36.130
Please.

1151
01:38:38.893 --> 01:38:40.791
Come on, Vengeance.

1152
01:38:43.223 --> 01:38:45.451
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1153
01:38:45.533 --> 01:38:47.142
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1154
01:38:56.461 --> 01:38:57.987
I told you, baby.

1155
01:38:59.885 --> 01:39:02.442
I can take care of myself.

1156
01:39:12.998 --> 01:39:16.257
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

1157
01:39:23.885 --> 01:39:27.432
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1158
01:39:27.556 --> 01:39:29.371
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

1159
01:39:29.577 --> 01:39:31.969
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

1160
01:39:32.134 --> 01:39:33.578
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1161
01:39:34.154 --> 01:39:36.464
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1162
01:39:37.659 --> 01:39:39.969
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1163
01:39:40.051 --> 01:39:42.485
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1164
01:39:42.567 --> 01:39:45.701
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1165
01:39:46.897 --> 01:39:51.515
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1166
01:39:51.599 --> 01:39:55.228
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1167
01:39:55.804 --> 01:39:57.329
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1168
01:39:57.412 --> 01:39:59.887
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1169
01:39:59.970 --> 01:40:01.577
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1170
01:40:01.661 --> 01:40:07.186
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

1171
01:40:07.269 --> 01:40:11.888
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

1172
01:40:11.971 --> 01:40:14.322
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1173
01:40:15.021 --> 01:40:17.496
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

1174
01:40:17.579 --> 01:40:21.456
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1175
01:40:21.579 --> 01:40:23.601
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1176
01:40:24.095 --> 01:40:28.343
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

1177
01:40:28.425 --> 01:40:30.982
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1178
01:40:31.106 --> 01:40:34.117
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1179
01:40:34.569 --> 01:40:39.766
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1180
01:40:40.261 --> 01:40:42.612
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1181
01:40:42.695 --> 01:40:45.045
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1182
01:40:45.127 --> 01:40:48.551
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1183
01:40:48.634 --> 01:40:51.396
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1184
01:40:52.797 --> 01:40:54.613
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1185
01:41:00.304 --> 01:41:01.376
Do you know who I am?

1186
01:41:02.859 --> 01:41:03.973
You're Bruce Wayne.

1187
01:41:04.056 --> 01:41:05.912
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1188
01:41:16.552 --> 01:41:17.542
See?

1189
01:41:28.593 --> 01:41:31.192
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1190
01:41:31.935 --> 01:41:34.038
Must have made a fortune.

1191
01:41:34.492 --> 01:41:36.224
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1192
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:40.142
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1193
01:41:40.224 --> 01:41:41.214
No, boss.

1194
01:41:41.297 --> 01:41:43.606
$1,183.

1195
01:41:43.934 --> 01:41:45.873
You know why communism failed, right?

1196
01:41:45.955 --> 01:41:46.945
No, boss.

1197
01:41:48.842 --> 01:41:50.079
Austerity.

1198
01:41:52.306 --> 01:41:53.915
All right. All right.

1199
01:41:54.079 --> 01:41:56.429
Look at that. Perfect.

1200
01:41:56.511 --> 01:41:58.244
It's never gonna be that good again.

1201
01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:02.904
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1202
01:42:02.987 --> 01:42:04.141
What are you doing here?

1203
01:42:06.039 --> 01:42:07.853
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1204
01:42:08.761 --> 01:42:09.791
Come on.

1205
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:12.885
See ya, champ.

1206
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:14.987
Come on, sweetheart.

1207
01:42:16.925 --> 01:42:17.915
Have a seat.

1208
01:42:19.936 --> 01:42:21.709
I thought I might hear from you.

1209
01:42:22.864 --> 01:42:25.958
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1210
01:42:27.359 --> 01:42:29.132
stirring things up, huh?

1211
01:42:29.214 --> 01:42:30.905
- Is it true?
- What?

1212
01:42:32.184 --> 01:42:33.793
That reporter business?

1213
01:42:35.113 --> 01:42:36.308
What do you want to know here, kid?

1214
01:42:36.391 --> 01:42:39.154
Did you kill him? For my father?

1215
01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:41.959
Look, your father was in trouble.

1216
01:42:42.825 --> 01:42:44.599
This reporter had some dirt.

1217
01:42:44.681 --> 01:42:46.290
Some very...

1218
01:42:47.319 --> 01:42:51.031
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1219
01:42:51.114 --> 01:42:53.795
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1220
01:42:53.877 --> 01:42:55.320
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1221
01:42:55.402 --> 01:42:57.300
not right before the election.

1222
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:59.897
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1223
01:42:59.979 --> 01:43:01.588
but he wasn't going for it.

1224
01:43:01.670 --> 01:43:04.805
So, he came to me.

1225
01:43:04.887 --> 01:43:07.238
Well, I never seen him like that.

1226
01:43:07.938 --> 01:43:09.753
He said, "Carmine,

1227
01:43:10.537 --> 01:43:15.197
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1228
01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:20.476
And when fear isn't enough...

1229
01:43:21.136 --> 01:43:22.951
Oof. Hmm.

1230
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:27.570
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1231
01:43:28.559 --> 01:43:30.374
I handled it.

1232
01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.342
I know.

1233
01:43:33.425 --> 01:43:35.652
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1234
01:43:36.764 --> 01:43:38.580
But you'd be surprised

1235
01:43:38.662 --> 01:43:41.012
what even a good man like him

1236
01:43:41.095 --> 01:43:43.652
is capable of in the right situation.

1237
01:43:45.879 --> 01:43:47.323
Do me a favor.

1238
01:43:47.652 --> 01:43:49.673
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1239
01:43:50.249 --> 01:43:51.817
This reporter

1240
01:43:52.641 --> 01:43:54.209
was a lowlife.

1241
01:43:54.292 --> 01:43:55.735
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1242
01:43:57.343 --> 01:43:58.952
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1243
01:43:59.694 --> 01:44:02.912
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1244
01:44:04.314 --> 01:44:07.778
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1245
01:44:07.861 --> 01:44:10.170
that your father would be in my pocket,

1246
01:44:10.912 --> 01:44:11.902
forever.

1247
01:44:12.437 --> 01:44:14.458
He would have done anything

1248
01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.685
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1249
01:44:16.768 --> 01:44:18.087
You understand?

1250
01:44:19.283 --> 01:44:23.779
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1251
01:44:23.862 --> 01:44:25.882
Do I know it for a fact?

1252
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:30.212
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1253
01:44:31.447 --> 01:44:33.716
This is what you wanted, huh?

1254
01:44:33.799 --> 01:44:36.191
This little conversation here?

1255
01:44:38.583 --> 01:44:40.728
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1256
01:44:43.325 --> 01:44:45.429
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1257
01:45:53.432 --> 01:45:54.711
You lied to me...

1258
01:45:57.515 --> 01:45:59.124
my whole life.

1259
01:46:04.238 --> 01:46:06.258
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1260
01:46:08.927 --> 01:46:12.185
He told me what he did for my father.

1261
01:46:16.278 --> 01:46:17.763
About Salvatore Maroni.

1262
01:46:19.742 --> 01:46:22.423
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1263
01:46:22.506 --> 01:46:24.238
Had my father killed.

1264
01:46:26.546 --> 01:46:28.732
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1265
01:46:31.455 --> 01:46:35.950
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1266
01:46:36.032 --> 01:46:38.342
believing that he was a good man.

1267
01:46:38.424 --> 01:46:39.991
He was a good man.

1268
01:46:41.146 --> 01:46:42.837
You listen to me.

1269
01:46:42.919 --> 01:46:46.302
Your father was a good man.

1270
01:46:49.765 --> 01:46:51.662
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1271
01:46:51.744 --> 01:46:53.642
He had a man killed.

1272
01:46:53.724 --> 01:46:54.797
Why?

1273
01:46:55.951 --> 01:46:59.169
To protect his family image?

1274
01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.478
His political aspirations?

1275
01:47:01.561 --> 01:47:05.066
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1276
01:47:07.498 --> 01:47:09.024
He was protecting your mother.

1277
01:47:09.972 --> 01:47:13.479
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1278
01:47:13.561 --> 01:47:15.461
He cared about her,

1279
01:47:15.622 --> 01:47:16.901
and you,

1280
01:47:16.983 --> 01:47:19.870
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1281
01:47:19.952 --> 01:47:23.376
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1282
01:47:24.242 --> 01:47:27.541
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1283
01:47:27.624 --> 01:47:30.589
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1284
01:47:30.674 --> 01:47:32.488
That's who Falcone is.

1285
01:47:34.716 --> 01:47:36.902
And that was your father's mistake.

1286
01:47:36.985 --> 01:47:39.005
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1287
01:47:39.088 --> 01:47:41.810
your father was distraught.

1288
01:47:42.675 --> 01:47:45.852
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1289
01:47:45.934 --> 01:47:48.078
that he would confess everything.

1290
01:47:49.439 --> 01:47:51.418
And that night,

1291
01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:55.378
your father and your mother were killed.

1292
01:48:00.821 --> 01:48:02.554
It was Falcone?

1293
01:48:08.409 --> 01:48:10.512
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1294
01:48:15.048 --> 01:48:18.553
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1295
01:48:18.635 --> 01:48:21.358
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1296
01:48:21.441 --> 01:48:26.596
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1297
01:48:28.328 --> 01:48:32.164
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1298
01:48:32.698 --> 01:48:34.472
I know you always blamed yourself.

1299
01:48:34.554 --> 01:48:37.070
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1300
01:48:39.215 --> 01:48:41.483
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1301
01:48:42.885 --> 01:48:45.236
but I didn't know how to help.

1302
01:48:45.319 --> 01:48:47.793
I could teach you how to fight,

1303
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:51.669
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1304
01:48:51.752 --> 01:48:53.566
You needed a father.

1305
01:48:55.504 --> 01:48:57.896
And all you had was me.

1306
01:49:00.122 --> 01:49:01.318
I'm sorry.

1307
01:49:03.051 --> 01:49:04.948
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1308
01:49:11.546 --> 01:49:12.618
God.

1309
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:20.000
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1310
01:49:22.681 --> 01:49:24.784
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1311
01:49:31.011 --> 01:49:32.249
I mean,

1312
01:49:33.444 --> 01:49:35.547
I'm not afraid to die.

1313
01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.630
I realize now there's something

1314
01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:42.475
I haven't got past.

1315
01:49:43.383 --> 01:49:45.115
This fear...

1316
01:49:47.548 --> 01:49:50.477
of ever going through any of that again.

1317
01:49:54.558 --> 01:49:56.744
Of losing somebody I care about.

1318
01:50:46.397 --> 01:50:47.345
Hey.

1319
01:50:47.428 --> 01:50:50.149
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1320
01:50:50.233 --> 01:50:52.129
I thought it was you.

1321
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:06.316
- I found him!
- I see that.

1322
01:51:06.399 --> 01:51:07.883
He had my shit and my phone.

1323
01:51:07.965 --> 01:51:09.162
She left a message
the night they took her.

1324
01:51:09.244 --> 01:51:10.151
She called me...

1325
01:51:10.233 --> 01:51:11.924
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1326
01:51:12.007 --> 01:51:13.286
She got my gun!

1327
01:51:14.605 --> 01:51:16.297
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1328
01:51:17.698 --> 01:51:20.213
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1329
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:26.812
Here. Listen.

1330
01:51:28.626 --> 01:51:30.275
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1331
01:51:30.399 --> 01:51:32.544
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1332
01:51:32.626 --> 01:51:34.689
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1333
01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:36.091
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1334
01:51:36.173 --> 01:51:37.864
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1335
01:51:37.947 --> 01:51:38.977
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1336
01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:40.339
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1337
01:51:40.421 --> 01:51:43.061
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1338
01:51:44.916 --> 01:51:46.937
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1339
01:51:47.513 --> 01:51:50.029
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
<i>- No, nothing. He...</i>

1340
01:51:50.112 --> 01:51:52.999
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1341
01:51:53.082 --> 01:51:55.762
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1342
01:51:56.173 --> 01:51:58.153
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1343
01:51:58.854 --> 01:52:01.700
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1344
01:52:01.782 --> 01:52:04.463
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1345
01:52:04.546 --> 01:52:06.649
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1346
01:52:06.731 --> 01:52:09.824
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1347
01:52:10.525 --> 01:52:13.041
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1348
01:52:14.113 --> 01:52:15.433
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1349
01:52:16.216 --> 01:52:19.722
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1350
01:52:20.217 --> 01:52:21.413
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1351
01:52:21.495 --> 01:52:23.433
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1352
01:52:23.516 --> 01:52:24.795
<i>The deal.</i>

1353
01:52:24.877 --> 01:52:29.478
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1354
01:52:29.701 --> 01:52:32.382
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1355
01:52:32.465 --> 01:52:34.815
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1356
01:52:34.898 --> 01:52:36.012
<i>Right.</i>

1357
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:37.990
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1358
01:52:38.939 --> 01:52:41.083
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1359
01:52:48.547 --> 01:52:49.867
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1360
01:52:49.949 --> 01:52:51.475
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1361
01:52:51.558 --> 01:52:54.569
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1362
01:53:03.683 --> 01:53:04.961
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1363
01:53:09.538 --> 01:53:11.311
A falcon has wings too.

1364
01:53:11.642 --> 01:53:13.456
Falcone is the rat?

1365
01:53:24.303 --> 01:53:27.437
Falcone works for you guys?

1366
01:53:27.973 --> 01:53:30.489
The mayor? The DA?

1367
01:53:33.333 --> 01:53:34.405
No.

1368
01:53:37.458 --> 01:53:38.736
We work for him.

1369
01:53:39.726 --> 01:53:40.963
Everybody does.

1370
01:53:41.045 --> 01:53:42.035
How?

1371
01:53:42.118 --> 01:53:43.685
Through Renewal.

1372
01:53:44.218 --> 01:53:45.579
Renewal is everything.

1373
01:53:45.662 --> 01:53:46.982
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1374
01:53:47.559 --> 01:53:51.230
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1375
01:53:51.312 --> 01:53:54.965
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1376
01:53:55.066 --> 01:53:58.408
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1377
01:53:58.490 --> 01:54:00.551
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1378
01:54:00.635 --> 01:54:02.325
Everybody got a piece.

1379
01:54:02.408 --> 01:54:04.223
But Falcone wanted more.

1380
01:54:05.871 --> 01:54:09.047
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1381
01:54:10.449 --> 01:54:12.758
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1382
01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:15.811
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1383
01:54:15.893 --> 01:54:18.327
then install them all as his puppets.

1384
01:54:18.409 --> 01:54:20.925
You think this goddamn election matters?

1385
01:54:22.533 --> 01:54:24.431
Falcone's the mayor.

1386
01:54:25.254 --> 01:54:27.729
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1387
01:54:27.811 --> 01:54:29.172
Come on, Vengeance.

1388
01:54:29.873 --> 01:54:31.688
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1389
01:54:32.389 --> 01:54:33.997
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1390
01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:34.905
No!

1391
01:54:36.224 --> 01:54:37.419
We'll get him.

1392
01:54:38.079 --> 01:54:39.935
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1393
01:54:40.018 --> 01:54:41.131
He owns the city!

1394
01:54:41.213 --> 01:54:42.451
Cross that line...

1395
01:54:43.235 --> 01:54:44.513
you'll become just like him.

1396
01:54:45.214 --> 01:54:46.740
Listen to me.

1397
01:54:46.823 --> 01:54:48.679
Don't throw your life away.

1398
01:54:55.029 --> 01:54:56.390
Don't worry, honey.

1399
01:54:59.442 --> 01:55:00.885
I got nine of 'em.

1400
01:55:01.009 --> 01:55:02.948
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1401
01:55:04.226 --> 01:55:05.505
Oh, God!

1402
01:55:14.702 --> 01:55:15.816
She won't get out of there alive.

1403
01:55:15.981 --> 01:55:18.538
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1404
01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:19.610
I have to stop her.

1405
01:55:19.775 --> 01:55:20.723
Don't you mean "we"?

1406
01:55:21.918 --> 01:55:23.444
I gotta do this my way.

1407
01:55:23.774 --> 01:55:24.764
And then what?

1408
01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:26.991
We do what Riddler said.

1409
01:55:27.691 --> 01:55:29.300
Bring the rat into the light.

1410
01:56:04.475 --> 01:56:06.497
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1411
01:56:06.579 --> 01:56:08.022
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1412
01:56:08.641 --> 01:56:09.960
Tell him it's about Annika.

1413
01:56:13.178 --> 01:56:14.497
Hey!

1414
01:56:15.198 --> 01:56:16.600
Look who it is, huh?

1415
01:56:16.682 --> 01:56:19.074
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1416
01:56:19.157 --> 01:56:21.137
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1417
01:56:21.301 --> 01:56:22.745
Absolutely.

1418
01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:25.467
Alone?

1419
01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:42.913
Hey!

1420
01:56:53.222 --> 01:56:54.418
I'm just so worried.

1421
01:56:54.501 --> 01:56:56.109
I don't know where she is.

1422
01:56:57.591 --> 01:57:00.933
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1423
01:57:01.015 --> 01:57:04.397
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1424
01:57:05.757 --> 01:57:08.107
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1425
01:57:09.551 --> 01:57:10.664
I'm sorry.

1426
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:11.943
It's okay.

1427
01:57:12.025 --> 01:57:14.128
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1428
01:57:14.293 --> 01:57:17.139
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1429
01:57:21.221 --> 01:57:22.129
Mr. Falcone?

1430
01:57:22.211 --> 01:57:23.654
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1431
01:57:23.737 --> 01:57:26.624
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1432
01:57:28.974 --> 01:57:30.460
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1433
01:57:30.542 --> 01:57:31.944
I'll be right back.

1434
01:57:46.955 --> 01:57:48.028
Holy shit.

1435
01:57:48.110 --> 01:57:49.760
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

1443

1451
01:58:32.649 --> 01:58:33.886
Hey, Dad.

1452
01:58:34.918 --> 01:58:35.907
What?

1453
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.381
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1454
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:41.434
You remember her?

1455
01:58:43.204 --> 01:58:44.236
Yeah.

1456
01:58:48.484 --> 01:58:49.556
Just put down the gun, honey.

1457
01:58:49.639 --> 01:58:50.711
This is for my mother.

1458
01:59:46.837 --> 01:59:47.992
I see him!

1459
02:00:31.170 --> 02:00:32.901
You don't think this hurts me?

1460
02:00:37.438 --> 02:00:39.707
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1461
02:00:55.666 --> 02:00:57.480
You made me do this.

1462
02:00:58.882 --> 02:01:00.655
Just like your mother.

1463
02:01:06.594 --> 02:01:07.915
He has to pay!

1464
02:01:11.792 --> 02:01:12.905
You don't have to pay with him.

1465
02:01:16.493 --> 02:01:17.978
You paid enough.

1466
02:01:51.793 --> 02:01:52.907
Jesus.

1467
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:55.526
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1468
02:01:55.627 --> 02:01:58.680
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1469
02:01:58.762 --> 02:01:59.999
I'm gonna start crying,

1470
02:02:00.082 --> 02:02:02.556
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1471
02:02:02.639 --> 02:02:04.247
Let me tell you something.

1472
02:02:04.330 --> 02:02:06.021
Whatever I know,

1473
02:02:06.103 --> 02:02:07.959
whatever I've done,

1474
02:02:08.041 --> 02:02:12.331
it's all going with me to my grave.

1475
02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.579
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1476
02:02:26.062 --> 02:02:28.331
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1477
02:02:36.167 --> 02:02:38.476
I guess we don't all work for you.

1478
02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:48.786
You have the right to remain silent.

1479
02:02:49.611 --> 02:02:53.075
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1480
02:02:53.158 --> 02:02:54.477
You have the right to an attorney.

1481
02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:55.715
If you cannot afford one,

1482
02:02:55.797 --> 02:02:57.571
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1483
02:02:57.653 --> 02:02:59.344
Do you understand these rights?

1484
02:03:00.704 --> 02:03:02.271
Do you understand?

1485
02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:05.282
Yeah.

1486
02:03:05.365 --> 02:03:07.427
I'll see you when I walk out.

1487
02:03:07.509 --> 02:03:08.498
With these rights in mind,

1488
02:03:08.582 --> 02:03:09.860
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1489
02:03:09.942 --> 02:03:11.179
Goddamn rat.

1490
02:03:12.868 --> 02:03:14.187
What'd you say?

1491
02:03:14.271 --> 02:03:16.003
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1492
02:03:17.116 --> 02:03:18.353
Probably be your last.

1493
02:03:18.601 --> 02:03:21.612
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1494
02:03:21.694 --> 02:03:22.767
Maybe I am.

1495
02:03:22.849 --> 02:03:24.045
Really, Oz?

1496
02:03:24.127 --> 02:03:28.788
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1497
02:03:28.871 --> 02:03:29.943
I'll spray paint your ass!

1498
02:03:33.984 --> 02:03:35.057
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1499
02:03:35.511 --> 02:03:37.490
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1500
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:40.253
Get your hands off of me!

1501
02:03:59.346 --> 02:04:01.326
"Bring him into the light.

1502
02:04:04.873 --> 02:04:06.812
And you'll find where I'm at."

1503
02:04:06.894 --> 02:04:07.966
There!

1504
02:04:08.049 --> 02:04:09.863
The shots came from up there!

1505
02:04:11.431 --> 02:04:12.420
It's Riddler.

1506
02:04:14.357 --> 02:04:15.512
Gage, on me.

1507
02:04:15.595 --> 02:04:18.276
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1508
02:05:31.022 --> 02:05:32.218
He's gone.

1509
02:05:41.785 --> 02:05:43.723
He's been here this whole time.

1510
02:05:43.806 --> 02:05:46.115
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1511
02:05:46.198 --> 02:05:47.312
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1512
02:05:47.394 --> 02:05:50.033
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1513
02:05:50.116 --> 02:05:52.550
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1514
02:05:52.632 --> 02:05:55.519
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

1515
02:06:10.736 --> 02:06:12.799
Police! Hands up!

1516
02:06:15.559 --> 02:06:19.024
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1517
02:06:37.954 --> 02:06:39.852
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1518
02:06:42.655 --> 02:06:43.933
Stay still!

1519
02:06:44.015 --> 02:06:45.005
Now!

1520
02:07:13.089 --> 02:07:14.862
Which one is you?

1521
02:07:14.945 --> 02:07:16.430
You tell me.

1522
02:07:17.254 --> 02:07:18.698
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1523
02:07:21.751 --> 02:07:23.482
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1524
02:07:37.585 --> 02:07:40.473
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1525
02:07:40.555 --> 02:07:43.112
<i>have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.</i>

1526
02:07:43.194 --> 02:07:45.751
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Reál's headquarters right now...</i>

1527
02:07:45.834 --> 02:07:46.864
Hey.

1528
02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:12.474
What are all these diaries?

1529
02:08:12.557 --> 02:08:14.949
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1530
02:08:15.031 --> 02:08:18.537
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1531
02:08:18.619 --> 02:08:20.145
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1532
02:08:20.228 --> 02:08:22.496
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1533
02:08:22.579 --> 02:08:24.235
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1534
02:08:24.351 --> 02:08:26.743
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1535
02:08:26.825 --> 02:08:28.558
What about chain of evidence?

1536
02:08:29.382 --> 02:08:30.579
You should see this.

1537
02:08:36.476 --> 02:08:37.961
He's wearing gloves.

1538
02:08:39.404 --> 02:08:41.631
"Friday, July 16th.

1539
02:08:41.714 --> 02:08:45.385
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1540
02:08:45.590 --> 02:08:48.600
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1541
02:08:48.683 --> 02:08:50.085
But then, today, I saw it.

1542
02:08:50.167 --> 02:08:54.250
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1543
02:08:55.570 --> 02:08:57.343
'Renewal.'

1544
02:08:57.426 --> 02:09:01.798
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1545
02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:04.973
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1546
02:09:05.056 --> 02:09:08.356
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1547
02:09:08.438 --> 02:09:10.872
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1548
02:09:10.954 --> 02:09:14.973
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1549
02:09:15.162 --> 02:09:16.976
"If you want people to understand,

1550
02:09:17.059 --> 02:09:18.874
really understand,

1551
02:09:18.956 --> 02:09:21.224
you can't just give them the answers.

1552
02:09:21.307 --> 02:09:22.751
You have to confront them,

1553
02:09:22.833 --> 02:09:25.225
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1554
02:09:25.308 --> 02:09:27.452
just like they tortured me.

1555
02:09:27.535 --> 02:09:30.298
I know now what I must become."

1556
02:09:33.227 --> 02:09:34.546
Jesus.

1557
02:09:40.568 --> 02:09:42.506
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1558
02:09:43.042 --> 02:09:44.527
This one's not a rat.

1559
02:10:00.983 --> 02:10:02.096
What is that?

1560
02:10:33.483 --> 02:10:34.680
Some kind of pry tool?

1561
02:10:34.762 --> 02:10:36.124
Is it a chisel?

1562
02:10:36.206 --> 02:10:37.649
It's a murder weapon.

1563
02:10:37.731 --> 02:10:39.093
He killed Mitchell with it.

1564
02:10:39.753 --> 02:10:42.598
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1565
02:10:51.095 --> 02:10:53.074
"My confession"?

1566
02:10:53.156 --> 02:10:56.002
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1567
02:10:56.085 --> 02:10:57.446
This isn't over.

1568
02:10:57.528 --> 02:10:59.920
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1569
02:11:00.333 --> 02:11:02.519
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1570
02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:12.706
His final post was last night.

1571
02:11:12.788 --> 02:11:15.964
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1572
02:11:16.046 --> 02:11:19.015
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1573
02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:22.522
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1574
02:11:33.739 --> 02:11:36.256
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1575
02:11:37.864 --> 02:11:39.555
"The Truth Unmasked."

1576
02:11:40.379 --> 02:11:41.988
I think I'm his last target.

1577
02:11:44.545 --> 02:11:45.617
You?

1578
02:11:45.989 --> 02:11:48.009
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1579
02:11:48.546 --> 02:11:49.907
What is?

1580
02:11:50.361 --> 02:11:51.763
The Batman.

1581
02:11:57.083 --> 02:11:58.238
Yeah?

1582
02:12:09.415 --> 02:12:10.611
Right.

1583
02:12:13.457 --> 02:12:17.375
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1584
02:12:24.758 --> 02:12:26.242
You're a good cop.

1585
02:12:50.575 --> 02:12:52.926
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1586
02:12:53.668 --> 02:12:55.483
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1587
02:12:55.566 --> 02:12:57.092
"Want"?

1588
02:12:57.669 --> 02:13:01.258
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

1589
02:13:02.453 --> 02:13:03.773
<i>For this moment.</i>

1590
02:13:04.804 --> 02:13:07.773
I've been invisible my whole life.

1591
02:13:08.971 --> 02:13:11.569
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1592
02:13:13.096 --> 02:13:15.488
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1593
02:13:15.570 --> 02:13:17.384
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1594
02:13:27.654 --> 02:13:29.592
<i>Bruce...</i>

1595
02:13:32.438 --> 02:13:34.253
<i>Wayne.</i>

1596
02:13:36.603 --> 02:13:40.315
Bruce...

1597
02:13:41.718 --> 02:13:44.563
<i>Wayne.</i>

1598
02:13:55.699 --> 02:13:58.092
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1599
02:14:00.648 --> 02:14:03.989
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

1600
02:14:04.071 --> 02:14:06.423
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1601
02:14:08.855 --> 02:14:13.063
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

1602
02:14:13.599 --> 02:14:17.104
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1603
02:14:17.187 --> 02:14:20.816
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1604
02:14:21.394 --> 02:14:22.920
<i>Orphan.</i>

1605
02:14:28.528 --> 02:14:33.601
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

1606
02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:39.458
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

1607
02:14:40.118 --> 02:14:41.644
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1608
02:14:44.242 --> 02:14:46.882
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1609
02:14:47.253 --> 02:14:49.810
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1610
02:14:51.089 --> 02:14:55.090
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

1611
02:14:56.780 --> 02:15:01.399
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

1612
02:15:02.679 --> 02:15:05.814
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1613
02:15:05.896 --> 02:15:08.164
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1614
02:15:09.443 --> 02:15:12.000
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1615
02:15:14.887 --> 02:15:18.021
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

1616
02:15:18.104 --> 02:15:20.991
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

1617
02:15:21.074 --> 02:15:22.064
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1618
02:15:23.506 --> 02:15:25.527
<i>Bruce...</i>

1619
02:15:26.559 --> 02:15:28.455
<i>Wayne.</i>

1620
02:15:32.085 --> 02:15:35.137
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1621
02:15:38.519 --> 02:15:41.612
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1622
02:15:43.056 --> 02:15:46.891
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1623
02:15:50.026 --> 02:15:51.181
<i>God.</i>

1624
02:15:52.171 --> 02:15:53.449
<i>Look at you.</i>

1625
02:15:55.099 --> 02:15:57.532
Your mask is amazing.

1626
02:15:57.614 --> 02:16:00.502
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1627
02:16:00.584 --> 02:16:01.774
Ain't it funny?

1628
02:16:01.864 --> 02:16:06.236
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

1629
02:16:07.679 --> 02:16:09.700
<i>You and I both know</i>

1630
02:16:10.649 --> 02:16:13.123
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1631
02:16:13.206 --> 02:16:16.794
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1632
02:16:16.876 --> 02:16:18.402
<i>No shame,</i>

1633
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:20.300
<i>no limits.</i>

1634
02:16:20.382 --> 02:16:22.032
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1635
02:16:22.898 --> 02:16:23.887
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1636
02:16:23.970 --> 02:16:25.661
<i>All those cards.</i>

1637
02:16:25.743 --> 02:16:26.940
<i>I told you,</i>

1638
02:16:27.641 --> 02:16:29.538
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

1639
02:16:29.621 --> 02:16:31.806
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1640
02:16:31.889 --> 02:16:33.333
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1641
02:16:33.415 --> 02:16:35.394
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

1642
02:16:35.477 --> 02:16:36.632
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1643
02:16:36.715 --> 02:16:37.704
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1644
02:16:37.786 --> 02:16:40.262
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1645
02:16:40.344 --> 02:16:42.736
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

1646
02:16:42.819 --> 02:16:45.952
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

1647
02:16:46.035 --> 02:16:47.643
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1648
02:16:47.726 --> 02:16:48.922
You gave me that.

1649
02:16:49.005 --> 02:16:50.118
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1650
02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.758
You showed me what was possible.

1651
02:16:52.841 --> 02:16:57.666
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

1652
02:16:57.748 --> 02:16:59.274
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1653
02:16:59.357 --> 02:17:00.841
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1654
02:17:01.955 --> 02:17:03.028
<i>What?</i>

1655
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:05.255
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1656
02:17:05.337 --> 02:17:06.698
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1657
02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:08.266
You think you'll be remembered?

1658
02:17:08.348 --> 02:17:09.997
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1659
02:17:10.492 --> 02:17:12.225
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

1660
02:17:12.307 --> 02:17:13.956
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

1661
02:17:14.039 --> 02:17:15.070
<i>No, no!</i>

1662
02:17:15.153 --> 02:17:16.060
<i>A nobody!</i>

1663
02:17:17.834 --> 02:17:19.607
<i>No!</i>

1664
02:17:21.504 --> 02:17:23.855
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1665
02:17:24.103 --> 02:17:26.660
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

1666
02:17:27.608 --> 02:17:31.196
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1667
02:17:31.279 --> 02:17:33.877
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1668
02:17:34.991 --> 02:17:36.971
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1669
02:17:37.343 --> 02:17:40.601
We could watch the whole thing together.

1670
02:17:40.683 --> 02:17:41.673
<i>Watch what?</i>

1671
02:17:41.756 --> 02:17:43.487
<i>Everything!</i>

1672
02:17:51.736 --> 02:17:53.386
<i>It was all there.</i>

1673
02:17:55.531 --> 02:17:57.841
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1674
02:18:02.089 --> 02:18:05.965
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

1675
02:18:07.986 --> 02:18:10.049
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1676
02:18:10.502 --> 02:18:11.740
<i>What have you done?</i>

1677
02:18:12.441 --> 02:18:17.266
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1678
02:18:20.071 --> 02:18:21.885
<i>You.</i>

1679
02:18:23.535 --> 02:18:25.638
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

1680
02:18:26.958 --> 02:18:28.484
<i>What have you done?</i>

1681
02:18:30.009 --> 02:18:35.784
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1682
02:18:36.197 --> 02:18:38.053
<i>What have you done?</i>

1683
02:18:40.485 --> 02:18:41.847
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1684
02:18:42.012 --> 02:18:43.414
<i>What have you done?</i>

1685
02:18:47.374 --> 02:18:50.863
<i>Maria</i>

1686
02:18:51.004 --> 02:18:56.489
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1687
02:19:27.999 --> 02:19:29.360
Hey!

1688
02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:31.629
What are you doing in here?

1689
02:19:49.362 --> 02:19:51.920
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1690
02:19:58.436 --> 02:20:00.870
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1691
02:20:01.736 --> 02:20:04.458
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1692
02:20:09.077 --> 02:20:12.088
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

1693
02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:14.315
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1694
02:20:14.397 --> 02:20:16.624
It's a tucker.

1695
02:20:34.235 --> 02:20:35.225
Huh.

1696
02:20:50.237 --> 02:20:53.000
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1697
02:20:53.083 --> 02:20:54.568
What are you doing?

1698
02:21:24.883 --> 02:21:26.285
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1699
02:21:26.614 --> 02:21:28.801
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

1700
02:21:28.883 --> 02:21:31.812
<i>and a special thanks to everyone

1701
02:21:31.894 --> 02:21:32.884
Detonators?

<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

1713
02:22:14.251 --> 02:22:16.107
<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

1714
02:22:16.189 --> 02:22:19.117
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

1715
02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:22.994
<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

1716
02:22:23.076 --> 02:22:26.870

<i>The day of judgment is finally upon us.</i>

<i>And now it is time</i>

1719
02:22:36.646 --> 02:22:38.998
<i>for retribution.</i>

1720
02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:41.843
<i>I've parked seven vans</i>

1721
02:22:42.132 --> 02:22:44.442

02:23:10.342 --> 02:23:11.786
Boom!

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

1727

Call Gordon.

1731
02:23:29.850 --> 02:23:31.953
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1732
02:23:33.521 --> 02:23:35.130
<i>As breaking news</i>

<i>Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.</i>

02:24:57.204 --> 02:24:59.349
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1752
02:24:59.926 --> 02:25:01.535
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

1753
02:25:01.617 --> 02:25:04.463
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1754
02:25:04.545 --> 02:25:06.484
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

1755
02:25:16.011 --> 02:25:17.661
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

1756
02:25:17.743 --> 02:25:19.227
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1757
02:25:19.310 --> 02:25:21.125
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1758
02:25:21.207 --> 02:25:22.523
We got an active situation.

1759
02:25:22.694 --> 02:25:23.972
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1760
02:25:24.054 --> 02:25:25.251
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

1761
02:25:25.333 --> 02:25:26.240
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

1762
02:25:26.323 --> 02:25:27.147
Come!

1763
02:26:02.781 --> 02:26:04.183
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

1764
02:26:04.266 --> 02:26:05.133
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1765
02:26:05.215 --> 02:26:06.576
The water's already started to breach.

1766
02:26:06.658 --> 02:26:08.184
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1767
02:26:08.267 --> 02:26:10.453
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1768
02:26:10.536 --> 02:26:12.350
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1769
02:26:12.432 --> 02:26:14.742
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1770
02:26:14.824 --> 02:26:17.051
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1771
02:26:17.134 --> 02:26:19.361
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1772
02:26:19.444 --> 02:26:21.259
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1773
02:26:21.341 --> 02:26:24.310
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1774
02:26:24.393 --> 02:26:25.878
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1775
02:26:30.867 --> 02:26:34.290
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1776
02:26:34.372 --> 02:26:36.641
Please! I just need your attention!

1777
02:26:52.354 --> 02:26:53.468
You're okay!

1778
02:28:23.752 --> 02:28:26.351
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1779
02:28:26.433 --> 02:28:27.629
Follow me, sir.

1780
02:30:36.184 --> 02:30:37.668
No, no. It's okay.

1781
02:30:37.751 --> 02:30:38.782
It's okay.

1782
02:30:39.936 --> 02:30:40.968
It's okay.

1783
02:30:42.577 --> 02:30:44.680
It's done now. It's done.

1784
02:30:47.361 --> 02:30:48.681
It's over.

1785
02:31:44.154 --> 02:31:47.578
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1786
02:31:48.279 --> 02:31:50.589
Take it easy. Easy.

1787
02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:19.953
Jesus.

1788
02:32:29.687 --> 02:32:31.336
Who the hell are you?

1789
02:32:35.502 --> 02:32:36.492
Me?

1790
02:32:39.626 --> 02:32:41.029
I'm Vengeance.

1791
02:36:11.370 --> 02:36:13.638
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1792
02:36:16.814 --> 02:36:18.670
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1793
02:36:20.979 --> 02:36:22.712
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1794
02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:26.960
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1795
02:36:27.868 --> 02:36:29.476
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1796
02:36:32.652 --> 02:36:36.322
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1797
02:36:36.404 --> 02:36:38.921
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>

1798
02:36:40.075 --> 02:36:43.745
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1799
02:36:46.674 --> 02:36:49.768
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1800
02:36:51.128 --> 02:36:52.490
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1801
02:36:53.108 --> 02:36:54.552
But not just our city.

1802
02:36:55.253 --> 02:36:59.419
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1803
02:36:59.501 --> 02:37:01.563
in our elected officials,

1804
02:37:01.646 --> 02:37:02.924
in each other.

1805
02:37:03.707 --> 02:37:07.007
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1806
02:37:11.297 --> 02:37:12.946
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1807
02:37:14.390 --> 02:37:16.534
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1808
02:37:18.596 --> 02:37:20.494
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1809
02:37:22.969 --> 02:37:25.980
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1810
02:37:27.299 --> 02:37:29.651
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1811
02:37:32.043 --> 02:37:34.064
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1812
02:37:36.991 --> 02:37:38.599
<i>People need hope.</i>

1813
02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:42.106
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1814
02:37:45.859 --> 02:37:47.509
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1815
02:37:48.416 --> 02:37:49.777
<i>scarred,</i>

1816
02:37:50.685 --> 02:37:51.922
<i>like me.</i>

1817
02:37:54.025 --> 02:37:56.088
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1818
02:37:57.448 --> 02:38:00.129
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1819
02:38:01.738 --> 02:38:03.470
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1820
02:38:04.954 --> 02:38:06.811
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1821
02:38:08.667 --> 02:38:10.563
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1822
02:38:11.512 --> 02:38:12.997
<i>to endure...</i>

1823
02:38:14.358 --> 02:38:16.462
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1824
02:38:19.348 --> 02:38:21.493
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

1825
02:38:21.576 --> 02:38:24.339
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

1826
02:38:24.422 --> 02:38:25.988
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1827
02:38:26.071 --> 02:38:27.679
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1828
02:38:27.762 --> 02:38:30.732
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

1829
02:38:30.814 --> 02:38:33.330
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1830
02:38:33.412 --> 02:38:35.828
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

1831
02:38:35.929 --> 02:38:38.363
Isn't that just terrible?

1832
02:38:39.724 --> 02:38:41.621
Him...

1833
02:38:41.703 --> 02:38:44.549
raining on your parade like that?

1834
02:38:50.199 --> 02:38:52.179
What is it they say?

1835
02:38:53.334 --> 02:38:55.479
"One day you're on top,

1836
02:38:57.005 --> 02:38:58.654
the next...

1837
02:39:00.016 --> 02:39:01.912
you're a clown."

1838
02:39:04.264 --> 02:39:05.419
Well,

1839
02:39:07.192 --> 02:39:09.996
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1840
02:39:12.264 --> 02:39:14.904
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1841
02:39:16.182 --> 02:39:17.998
You did so well.

1842
02:39:22.451 --> 02:39:23.441
And you know,

1843
02:39:25.091 --> 02:39:28.267
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1844
02:39:38.207 --> 02:39:39.567
Who are you?

1845
02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:42.495
Well, that's the question,

1846
02:39:43.733 --> 02:39:44.887
isn't it?

1847
02:39:47.775 --> 02:39:50.125
Riddle me this...

1848
02:39:52.559 --> 02:39:54.662
"The less of them you have,

1849
02:39:55.405 --> 02:39:59.199
the more one is worth."

1850
02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:06.293
A friend.

1851
02:40:32.235 --> 02:40:33.225
You're leaving.

1852
02:40:34.131 --> 02:40:35.204
Jesus.

1853
02:40:36.936 --> 02:40:38.503
Don't you ever just say hello?

1854
02:40:43.535 --> 02:40:44.938
Where will you go?

1855
02:40:46.422 --> 02:40:48.814
I don't know. Upstate.

1856
02:40:49.226 --> 02:40:50.918
Bludhaven, maybe.

1857
02:40:51.783 --> 02:40:52.773
Why?

1858
02:40:53.970 --> 02:40:55.165
You asking me to stay?

1859
02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:04.364
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1860
02:41:04.776 --> 02:41:07.086
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1861
02:41:07.169 --> 02:41:09.066
There's gonna be a power grab.

1862
02:41:10.675 --> 02:41:11.788
It'll be bloody.

1863
02:41:12.406 --> 02:41:13.602
I know.

1864
02:41:15.128 --> 02:41:16.201
But the city can change.

1865
02:41:16.283 --> 02:41:17.520
It won't.

1866
02:41:18.634 --> 02:41:19.624
I have to try.

1867
02:41:19.707 --> 02:41:21.480
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1868
02:41:23.748 --> 02:41:24.861
Listen.

1869
02:41:27.253 --> 02:41:28.491
Why don't you come with me?

1870
02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:30.925
Get into some trouble.

1871
02:41:31.667 --> 02:41:35.132
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1872
02:41:35.791 --> 02:41:37.400
The bat and the cat.

1873
02:41:38.884 --> 02:41:40.535
It's got a nice ring.

1874
02:41:53.732 --> 02:41:55.134
Who am I kidding?

1875
02:41:56.578 --> 02:41:58.681
You're already spoken for.

1876
02:42:10.435 --> 02:42:11.837
You should go.

1877
02:42:20.211 --> 02:42:21.201
Selina...

1878
02:42:25.242 --> 02:42:26.893
Take care of yourself.
