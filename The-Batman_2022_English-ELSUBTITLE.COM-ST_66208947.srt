Hey!

3
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:44,336
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

4
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:51,335
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

5
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:52,944
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

6
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:55,336
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

7
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:59,212
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

8
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,780
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

9
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:04,286
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

10
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:08,461
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

11
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:10,386
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

12
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:13,106
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

13
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:14,514
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

14
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:18,721
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

15
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:21,720
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

16
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:23,271
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

17
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,154
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

18
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:26,310
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

19
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:27,492
<i>Under my administration,</i>

20
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:31,346
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

21
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:34,955
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

22
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,156
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

23
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,188
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

24
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,604
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

25
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:40,580
<i>But listen...</i>

26
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,064
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

27
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:43,591
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

28
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,096
Hey.

29
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:53,159
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

30
00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:59,964
Why is she still tied?

31
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,520
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

32
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,923
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

33
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:18,862
Just call me in the morning, okay?

34
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:24,429
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

35
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:27,075
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,800
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

37
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:50,728
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

38
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:06,228
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

39
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:11,012
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

40
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:17,899
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

41
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:20,868
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

42
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:23,838
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

43
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:26,560
<i>Watching.</i>

44
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:32,499
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

45
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,583
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

46
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:55,884
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

47
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:58,647
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

48
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,214
<i>It's a big city.</i>

49
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,559
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

50
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,931
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

51
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:25,778
Look at this guy, man.

52
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:31,882
Boom!

53
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:33,201
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

54
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,778
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

55
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:40,263
Yo, let's see your hits.

56
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:42,448
That's you.

57
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,576
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

58
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:10,544
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

59
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,390
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

60
00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:16,483
<i>It's a warning.</i>

61
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,245
<i>To them.</i>

62
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:30,052
<i>Fear...</i>

63
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,124
<i>is a tool.</i>

64
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:49,229
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

65
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:03,509
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

66
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:07,426
Come on!

67
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:47,702
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

68
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:07,906
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

69
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:10,339
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

70
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:11,865
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

71
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:14,051
Help!

72
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:15,330
Somebody help me!

73
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:18,093
Help, help!

74
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,095
Where you goin', huh?

75
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:31,786
Come on.

76
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:33,518
Come on, man. Break it.

77
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,065
You can't move, huh?

78
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:39,127
Now knock his ass out.

79
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,900
Showtime. Showtime, man.

80
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:42,509
Come on, man.

81
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:43,828
Come on. Do it, man.

82
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:20,370
You see this guy?

83
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:29,113
The hell are you supposed to be?

84
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,219
I'm vengeance.

85
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,230
Holy shit. It's him.

86
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,749
Hey, man. No, no, no!

87
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,520
Please don't hurt me.

88
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:36,721
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:39,484
Police action.

90
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:41,711
He's with me, Officer.

91
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,506
Are you kidding me, sir?

92
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:48,145
You're gonna let him in here?

93
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:51,568
Martinez, let him through.

94
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:06,787
Goddamn freak.

95
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,573
What do we know?

96
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,757
Detective?

97
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,448
Sorry, Lieutenant.

98
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:42,769
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

99
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,645
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

100
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,388
All this blood is from his head?

101
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:52,831
No.

102
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:58,317
Excuse me.

103
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:02,441
Most of it's from his hand.

104
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:08,875
Thumb was severed.

105
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:12,719
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

106
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,988
He was alive when it was cut off.

107
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,668
Ecchymosis...

108
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,432
around the wound.

109
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:37,226
Security detail downstairs

110
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,495
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

111
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,165
The mayor was up here alone.

112
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:48,238
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

113
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:56,322
You said there was a card.

114
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:57,971
Yeah.

115
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:11,054
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

116
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,024
Haven't a clue?

117
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,457
Let's play a game, just me and you.

118
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:20,054
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

119
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:23,436
There's a cipher too.

120
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:31,974
Any of this mean anything to you?

121
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:35,685
What's going on here?

122
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,139
I asked him to come, Pete.

123
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,872
This is a crime scene.

124
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:44,264
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

125
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:46,326
I got the press downstairs.

126
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:49,130
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

127
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,027
But this is way over the line.

128
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:55,729
Wait.

129
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:57,502
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

130
00:15:57,585 --> 00:15:58,699
How do you know?

131
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:01,750
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

132
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,565
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

133
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,256
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

134
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,865
He lies still.

135
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,440
Excuse me?

136
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,038
The riddle.

137
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:15,997
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

138
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:26,514
Oh, Jesus.

139
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:32,495
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

140
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:35,299
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

141
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,691
Excuse me, Commissioner.

142
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,413
They're ready for your statement.

143
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,104
I want him outta here.

144
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:47,795
Now!

145
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:55,508
Come on.

146
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:09,366
Yeah.

147
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,005
The kid found him.

148
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,923
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

149
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:38,318
We really gotta go, man.

150
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:47,515
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

151
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,783
A wife lost a husband.

152
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,506
And I lost a friend.

153
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,093
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

154
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:59,228
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

155
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:01,827
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

156
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:05,951
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

157
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:10,075
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

158
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:11,395
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

159
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:14,282
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

160
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:16,081
<i>but I don't know.</i>

161
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:24,784
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

162
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:26,928
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

163
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:28,991
<i>And now this.</i>

164
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:32,703
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

165
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:36,621
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

166
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,951
<i>But I have to try.</i>

167
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:42,972
<i>Push myself.</i>

168
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:31,120
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

169
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,966
<i>behind the mask.</i>

170
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,689
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

171
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:44,607
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

172
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:48,524
<i>everything that happened.</i>

173
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,485
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

174
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:08,404
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

175
00:20:08,486 --> 00:20:11,290
<i>was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

176
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,105
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

177
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:14,837
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

178
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,405
<i>still have not been released,</i>

179
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:19,333
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

180
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,632
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

181
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:24,530
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

182
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:27,128
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

183
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:31,467
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

184
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,282
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

185
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:35,303
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

186
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:38,189
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

187
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:42,067
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

188
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:43,923
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

189
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:46,645
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

190
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:49,944
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

191
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:53,945
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

192
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:58,151
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

193
00:20:58,234 --> 00:20:59,636
I assume you heard about this.

194
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:02,730
Yeah.

195
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:11,077
Oh, I see.

196
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,800
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

197
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:15,532
Dear God.

198
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:26,214
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

199
00:21:34,132 --> 00:21:36,401
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

200
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:41,309
The killer left this for the Batman?

201
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:44,361
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

202
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:45,434
Apparently.

203
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,578
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

204
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,919
Why is he writing to you?

205
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:52,403
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

206
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:53,517
I don't know yet.

207
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,125
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

208
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:58,384
Have a shower.

209
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,477
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

210
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,467
are coming for breakfast.

211
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,529
Here? Why?

212
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:05,683
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

213
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:06,838
I haven't got time for this.

214
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:08,571
It's getting serious, Bruce.

215
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:11,705
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

216
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:13,355
I don't care about that.

217
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:15,129
Any of that.

218
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:16,696
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

219
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,140
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

220
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:24,366
If I can't change things here,

221
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:26,800
if I can't have an effect,

222
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:29,481
then I don't care what happens to me.

223
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:30,677
That's what I'm afraid of.

224
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,368
Alfred, stop.

225
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,172
You're not my father.

226
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:39,337
I'm well aware.

227
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,508
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

228
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:42,489
Some fresh berries there.

229
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,697
What are you doing?

230
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:54,698
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

231
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:58,946
This is actually quite elusive.

232
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,565
Where'd you get those O's?

233
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,854
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

234
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:10,428
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

235
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:14,512
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

236
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:15,955
see where it leads.

237
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:18,892
That's interesting.

238
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:21,243
Mr. Pennyworth?

239
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:22,604
Yes, Dory?

240
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:24,377
The accountants are here.

241
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,275
See them in, please, Dory.

242
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:31,348
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

243
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,997
What do you mean?

244
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,895
What if this is the whole key?

245
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:38,318
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

246
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,421
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

247
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:41,658
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

248
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,844
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

249
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:45,741
I don't see how that's gonna...

250
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:49,247
Oh.

251
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:04,548
Damn.

252
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,940
Yeah, he's got a car.

253
00:25:07,848 --> 00:25:10,198
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

254
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,931
Where to even start?

255
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:14,817
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

256
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,890
You don't trust me?

257
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,538
You mean like you trust me?

258
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:21,467
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

259
00:25:23,446 --> 00:25:24,560
There.

260
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:48,687
What are we looking for?

261
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:50,831
A USB port.

262
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:52,028
USB?

263
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,194
What?

264
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:07,742
"Thumb" drive.

265
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,134
Jesus.

266
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:15,206
It's encrypted.

267
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:19,867
Try this.

268
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,146
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

269
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,488
Oh, well, well, well.

270
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,127
So much for family values.

271
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:44,447
Who is she?

272
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:46,097
No idea.

273
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:49,809
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

274
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:51,623
I know who he is.

275
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,117
What was that?

276
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:57,654
Shit, shit! The drive.

277
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:00,755
It sent out the photos from my account.

278
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:03,354
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

279
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:05,499
Jesus.

280
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:07,932
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

281
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:09,458
"He lies still."

282
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:10,695
About her?

283
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:13,500
Maybe.

284
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,521
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

285
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:18,986
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

286
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:21,171
Never get in there without a warrant.

287
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:24,553
Yeah.

288
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:38,699
Know who I am?

289
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,246
Yeah. I got an idea.

290
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,102
I want to see the Penguin.

291
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:47,080
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

292
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:53,391
What's the problem?

293
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:54,875
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

294
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:57,102
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

295
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:58,793
That's what I tried to tell him.

296
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,144
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

297
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:03,083
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

298
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:05,516
Mine or yours?

299
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:14,713
Get him!

300
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:15,950
I saw that whole thing.

301
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:17,229
He's over there!

302
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:18,631
What is your problem?

303
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:03,018
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

304
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:14,946
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:17,173
Take it easy, sweetheart.

306
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,029
You looking for me?

307
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,626
I see you met the twins.

308
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:25,834
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

309
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,184
I guess we both are.

310
00:29:30,256 --> 00:29:31,658
How you doing?

311
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:33,679
I'm Oz.

312
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:40,401
Who is she?

313
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:45,309
I really don't know, chief.

314
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,196
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

315
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:49,640
but I wasn't rolling with them.

316
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,910
It's okay, baby.

317
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:08,198
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

318
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:34,842
Thank you, honey.

319
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:43,091
Here you go, champ.

320
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:46,678
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

321
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,584
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

322
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,440
Is that the mayor?

323
00:30:50,523 --> 00:30:52,296
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

324
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:54,771
Don't make me hurt you.

325
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,978
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

326
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,038
Yeah, I do. Do you?

327
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,256
Look...

328
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:09,256
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

329
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:14,329
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

330
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:24,144
Tell you one thing.

331
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:29,886
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

332
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,906
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

333
00:31:36,122 --> 00:31:37,937
What? Too soon?

334
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:50,022
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

335
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:00,209
Taxi!

336
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:03,673
Taxi!

337
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,511
Hey, it's me.

338
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:26,109
Baby, what's wrong?

339
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:28,749
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

340
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,584
On the news?

341
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:36,502
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

342
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:38,276
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

343
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:43,019
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

344
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,318
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

345
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:48,380
Uh...

346
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:51,885
God damn it.

347
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:13,621
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

348
00:33:13,703 --> 00:33:15,559
<i>with a younger mystery woman.</i>

349
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:18,447
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

350
00:33:51,623 --> 00:33:54,510
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

351
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:07,639
You're pretty good at that.

352
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:41,005
Hey! Give me that.

353
00:36:44,592 --> 00:36:47,108
"Kosolov, Annika."

354
00:36:48,243 --> 00:36:50,305
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

355
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:53,110
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

356
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:32,863
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

357
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:35,378
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

358
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,822
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

359
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:38,637
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

360
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,080
What does she know?

361
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:42,266
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

362
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:43,916
She did seem upset.

363
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:47,174
Back at your place.

364
00:37:49,194 --> 00:37:50,680
Let's go talk to her.

365
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,402
Anni!

366
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:19,754
Baby!

367
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,393
Anni!

368
00:38:26,394 --> 00:38:27,631
Anni!

369
00:38:30,064 --> 00:38:31,425
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

370
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,693
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

371
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,507
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

372
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:40,748
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

373
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:43,135
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>

374
00:38:43,218 --> 00:38:46,023
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

375
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:49,611
Shit, they took my phone.

376
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:51,054
<i>His victim, longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,</i>

377
00:38:51,137 --> 00:38:52,539
<i>Commissioner Pete Savage,</i>

378
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,725
<i>was found dead earlier tonight</i>

379
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:57,983
<i>inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.</i>

380
00:38:58,066 --> 00:39:01,242
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>

381
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:04,168
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

382
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:11,755
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

383
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,776
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

384
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:16,870
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

385
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:21,695
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>

386
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,798
<i>But I am not done.</i>

387
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,078
<i>Here is another...</i>

388
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:36,295
<i>who will soon be losing face.</i>

389
00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:41,583
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

390
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:43,553
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

391
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:48,584
<i>when the truth about our city
will finally...</i>

392
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:51,348
<i>be unmasked.</i>

393
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:54,397
<i>Goodbye!</i>

394
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:00,212
<i>Commissioner Savage
served a distinguished</i>

395
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:02,399
<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

396
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:04,667
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

397
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,017
At the club.

398
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:09,944
The Iceberg Lounge?

399
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:12,130
44 Below.

400
00:40:14,027 --> 00:40:15,017
What is that?

401
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:19,635
The club within the club.

402
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:22,605
The real club.

403
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:26,606
It's a mob hangout.

404
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,462
Is that where you work?

405
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:31,183
Selina?

406
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,729
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

407
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:43,679
But I see 'em come in.

408
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:44,957
Who?

409
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:47,927
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

410
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,008
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

411
00:40:54,236 --> 00:40:55,762
You're gonna help me on this.

412
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,865
For your friend.

413
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,535
You got a lot of cats.

414
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,918
I have a thing about strays.

415
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:18,320
You're not safe here.

416
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:20,463
I can take care of myself.

417
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:23,309
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

418
00:41:23,392 --> 00:41:24,918
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

419
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,217
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

420
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,104
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

421
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,806
He waited for him at the gym.

422
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:54,940
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

423
00:41:55,022 --> 00:41:57,126
when no one else was around.

424
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,642
There's a needle mark on his neck.

425
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:01,662
Injected him with arsenic.

426
00:42:03,517 --> 00:42:04,837
Rat poison.

427
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,188
Yeah.

428
00:42:07,353 --> 00:42:09,786
That seems to be his theme here.

429
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:11,683
Look at this thing.

430
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:21,458
It's a maze.

431
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,148
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

432
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,942
More symbols.

433
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:34,860
It's another cipher.

434
00:42:34,942 --> 00:42:37,664
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

435
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:40,881
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

436
00:42:40,964 --> 00:42:44,057
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

437
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:46,943
I don't get it.

438
00:42:47,026 --> 00:42:49,377
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

439
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,139
Looks like he got greedy.

440
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:53,253
You kidding me?

441
00:42:53,335 --> 00:42:56,015
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

442
00:42:56,098 --> 00:42:59,315
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

443
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:01,584
Maybe he's not who you thought.

444
00:43:02,984 --> 00:43:05,006
You make it sound like he had it coming.

445
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:08,676
He was a cop.

446
00:43:09,996 --> 00:43:11,275
Crossed a line.

447
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,440
"I'm mad about you.

448
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:47,152
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

449
00:43:54,204 --> 00:43:57,257
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

450
00:43:57,422 --> 00:44:00,969
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

451
00:44:01,051 --> 00:44:02,742
The hell is that?

452
00:44:03,484 --> 00:44:06,619
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

453
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:09,092
I don't know.

454
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:11,113
Lieutenant.

455
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:12,597
They're coming back.

456
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,917
We got to get out of here.

457
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,155
Come on.

458
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,093
Ow!

459
00:44:26,536 --> 00:44:27,857
I don't know about these things.

460
00:44:27,939 --> 00:44:31,362
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

461
00:44:35,196 --> 00:44:37,753
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

462
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,052
I'm just looking for Annika.

463
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,909
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

464
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:50,496
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

465
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:01,137
Look at me.

466
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:12,683
Looks good. Here.

467
00:45:54,995 --> 00:45:56,974
I got you. Can you hear me?

468
00:45:57,799 --> 00:45:58,789
Yeah.

469
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:08,357
Hey, where you goin'?

470
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,089
Hospitality.

471
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:13,636
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

472
00:46:15,284 --> 00:46:16,768
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

473
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:25,304
"Kenzie, William."

474
00:46:25,388 --> 00:46:26,830
He's an off-duty cop.

475
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,337
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

476
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,687
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

477
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:52,029
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

478
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:53,225
Great.

479
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,669
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

480
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:04,319
Feels good, doesn't it?

481
00:47:04,402 --> 00:47:06,587
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

482
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:14,052
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

483
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,165
Really?

484
00:47:15,247 --> 00:47:16,196
'Cause when I first saw you,

485
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:17,475
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

486
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:19,784
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

487
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:22,010
Can we not do this right now?

488
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,433
Wait. Who was that?

489
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:26,671
Oh, I saw him.

490
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:27,826
<i>Look back.</i>

491
00:47:27,908 --> 00:47:29,681
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

492
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,083
I need to see his face.

493
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:34,052
Jesus.

494
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:43,125
That's the DA.

495
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:44,239
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

496
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:45,971
And he's coming over. You happy?

497
00:47:46,054 --> 00:47:47,249
<i>Talk to him.</i>

498
00:47:50,217 --> 00:47:51,290
Hey. How you doing?

499
00:47:51,372 --> 00:47:52,445
Hi.

500
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:53,352
I'm Gil.

501
00:47:54,548 --> 00:47:56,156
Hey, aren't you the DA?

502
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:57,188
Yeah.

503
00:47:57,394 --> 00:47:59,539
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

504
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:00,982
Is that right?

505
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:03,455
I haven't seen you around here before.

506
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:06,466
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

507
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:09,064
'cause people are all a little on edge.

508
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:10,631
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

509
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:11,704
<i>Is that right?</i>

510
00:48:11,993 --> 00:48:13,189
<i>I like that.</i>

511
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:14,591
Do you want to come over?

512
00:48:14,674 --> 00:48:15,787
Sure.

513
00:48:18,632 --> 00:48:19,951
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

514
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:21,436
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

515
00:48:21,725 --> 00:48:23,581
- <i>Richie, Glen.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

516
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,384
That's half the DA's office.

517
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:27,621
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

518
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:28,652
Hi.

519
00:48:28,734 --> 00:48:30,756
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

520
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:32,694
Drowning our sorrows.

521
00:48:33,024 --> 00:48:34,303
<i>You want a drop?</i>

522
00:48:34,385 --> 00:48:36,406
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

523
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,869
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

524
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,973
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

525
00:48:42,426 --> 00:48:43,375
He's wasted.

526
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:44,488
No shit.

527
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:47,127
<i>I like this girl.</i>

528
00:48:47,581 --> 00:48:49,149
Oh, hey, I like you too!

529
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:55,829
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

530
00:48:55,911 --> 00:48:56,984
<i>He knows so much.</i>

531
00:48:57,066 --> 00:48:58,344
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

532
00:48:58,427 --> 00:49:00,654
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

533
00:49:00,736 --> 00:49:01,644
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

534
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:03,624
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

535
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:05,645
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

536
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,439
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

537
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:20,738
<i>I mean...</i>

538
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:25,110
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

539
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,954
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

540
00:49:28,037 --> 00:49:29,728
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

541
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,378
He's talking about the Maroni case.

542
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,718
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

543
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:37,439
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

544
00:49:37,522 --> 00:49:39,419
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

545
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:42,099
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

546
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:43,419
What do you know about that?

547
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:46,182
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

548
00:49:46,265 --> 00:49:47,214
<i>I want a drink.</i>

549
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:48,616
Keep him talking.

550
00:49:51,543 --> 00:49:52,615
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

551
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:53,729
She knows Annika.

552
00:49:53,812 --> 00:49:55,214
No, stay on the DA.

553
00:49:55,296 --> 00:49:57,194
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

554
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:01,275
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

555
00:50:01,357 --> 00:50:02,389
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

556
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:04,987
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

557
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:06,306
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

558
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:08,823
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

559
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,792
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

560
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,359
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

561
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:14,514
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

562
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,247
<i>Hey.</i>

563
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:21,896
Hey.

564
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:26,186
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

565
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,535
How you been?

566
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:32,536
Yeah, I've been okay.

567
00:50:33,856 --> 00:50:35,217
<i>I was just...</i>

568
00:50:37,113 --> 00:50:38,927
I was just headed back upstairs.

569
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,660
Well...

570
00:50:41,732 --> 00:50:43,381
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

571
00:50:57,197 --> 00:50:59,547
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

572
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,198
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

573
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,053
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

574
00:51:03,136 --> 00:51:04,950
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

575
00:51:05,032 --> 00:51:06,105
Wait, what are you doing?

576
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:08,579
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

577
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:13,981
Taxi!

578
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,890
Hey!

579
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:21,527
I lost you in there.

580
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:22,682
Yeah, I gotta go.

581
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:24,951
Oh, you need a ride?

582
00:51:25,652 --> 00:51:26,931
That's me right there.

583
00:51:32,827 --> 00:51:33,899
Taxi!

584
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:35,095
I'm good.

585
00:51:36,786 --> 00:51:38,188
I hope, uh...

586
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,002
I'll see you around.

587
00:53:08,955 --> 00:53:12,709
Just hold still.

588
00:54:09,657 --> 00:54:10,564
What do you know about

589
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,916
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

590
00:54:16,217 --> 00:54:17,908
Yeah, sure, there was.

591
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:20,424
That's the rat we're looking for.

592
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:23,188
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

593
00:54:23,765 --> 00:54:26,735
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

594
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:28,260
Where are you getting this?

595
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:31,188
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

596
00:54:31,847 --> 00:54:33,291
Gil's very nervous.

597
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,755
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

598
00:54:36,837 --> 00:54:38,693
I worked that case.

599
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,714
Riddler's not after you.

600
00:54:40,796 --> 00:54:41,704
How do you know?

601
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,353
You're not corrupt.

602
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:45,909
Colson's dirty?

603
00:54:51,725 --> 00:54:53,210
Maybe I, uh...

604
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,169
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

605
00:54:57,251 --> 00:55:00,510
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

606
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:02,900
Who knows how many people it touches.

607
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:06,158
Politicians. Police. The courts.

608
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,128
It could tear the whole city apart.

609
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,561
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

610
00:55:13,045 --> 00:55:14,778
And Riddler's the match.

611
00:55:15,643 --> 00:55:16,798
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

612
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:18,160
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

613
00:55:18,242 --> 00:55:19,644
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

614
00:55:19,727 --> 00:55:21,211
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

615
00:55:22,243 --> 00:55:23,810
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

616
00:55:23,892 --> 00:55:25,541
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

617
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,098
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

618
00:55:28,182 --> 00:55:29,213
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

619
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:30,904
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

620
00:55:30,986 --> 00:55:32,800
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

621
00:55:32,883 --> 00:55:34,120
Pretty.

622
00:55:35,975 --> 00:55:37,336
She a new friend of yours?

623
00:55:41,748 --> 00:55:42,944
I'm not so sure.

624
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:45,253
Looks like you upset her.

625
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:48,511
Shall I take this as a good sign?

626
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:49,584
What?

627
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:50,574
Your attire.

628
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:52,759
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

629
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:54,822
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

630
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:57,543
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

631
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,017
Riddler might not be able to resist.

632
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,543
Oh, that reminds me.

633
00:56:02,698 --> 00:56:06,616
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

634
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:08,512
The one from the rat maze.

635
00:56:08,924 --> 00:56:11,977
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

636
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:14,162
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

637
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:17,462
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

638
00:56:17,955 --> 00:56:19,358
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

639
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,636
"Rat with wings"?

640
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:23,193
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

641
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:24,513
Yeah.

642
00:56:25,956 --> 00:56:27,070
A stool pigeon.

643
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,926
Where are your cufflinks?

644
00:56:29,008 --> 00:56:29,957
I couldn't find them.

645
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:33,214
Well, you can't go out like that.

646
00:56:33,296 --> 00:56:35,070
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

647
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:41,957
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

648
00:56:43,648 --> 00:56:45,834
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

649
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:48,598
Your father gave them to me.

650
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:57,257
No more lies! No more lies!

651
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,167
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

652
00:57:30,331 --> 00:57:32,064
Is that Bruce Wayne?

653
00:57:32,146 --> 00:57:34,745
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

654
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:44,600
Hold it.

655
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,157
You good, fellas?

656
00:57:47,735 --> 00:57:48,724
Good.

657
00:57:50,703 --> 00:57:51,776
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

658
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:10,376
Sir?

659
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:30,541
Hey!

660
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:32,603
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

661
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,367
Hey, watch it, fellas.

662
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:38,088
You got the prince of the city there.

663
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,583
Some event, huh?

664
00:58:42,665 --> 00:58:45,594
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

665
00:58:45,676 --> 00:58:48,110
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

666
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:49,801
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

667
00:58:49,883 --> 00:58:51,862
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

668
00:58:52,603 --> 00:58:54,006
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

669
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,068
Wow. Is that right?

670
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:58,172
His father saved my life.

671
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:02,171
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

672
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:06,832
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

673
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,046
Operated right on the dining room table.

674
00:59:10,253 --> 00:59:15,450
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

675
00:59:16,852 --> 00:59:18,832
I remember your face.

676
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:22,749
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

677
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,225
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

678
00:59:26,544 --> 00:59:28,111
"Hippocratic oath."

679
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:31,823
That's good.

680
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:33,389
Excuse me.

681
00:59:36,936 --> 00:59:37,761
Yes.

682
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:52,730
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

683
00:59:52,813 --> 00:59:54,381
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

684
00:59:54,463 --> 00:59:56,814
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

685
00:59:56,896 --> 00:59:58,669
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

686
00:59:58,752 --> 01:00:00,155
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

687
01:00:00,237 --> 01:00:01,639
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

688
01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:03,124
<i>consider a donation to</i>

689
01:00:03,206 --> 01:00:05,227
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

690
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:07,537
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

691
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:08,816
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

692
01:00:09,062 --> 01:00:11,577
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

693
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:16,236
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

694
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,494
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

695
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:22,340
He got what he deserved.

696
01:00:24,238 --> 01:00:25,228
Know what I mean?

697
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:28,485
Hey, don't I know you?

698
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:29,640
Bruce Wayne.

699
01:00:30,546 --> 01:00:32,485
Why haven't you called me back?

700
01:00:32,568 --> 01:00:33,557
I'm sorry?

701
01:00:33,846 --> 01:00:36,156
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

702
01:00:36,238 --> 01:00:37,435
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

703
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:40,156
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

704
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:41,558
Will you walk with me?

705
01:00:46,547 --> 01:00:47,867
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,146
Mr. Wayne.

707
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:52,899
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

708
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:55,167
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

709
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:57,641
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

710
01:00:57,723 --> 01:01:00,156
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

711
01:01:00,734 --> 01:01:02,012
Thank you.

712
01:01:02,879 --> 01:01:03,869
My God.

713
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:08,033
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

714
01:01:08,115 --> 01:01:09,724
I want to continue this.

715
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:14,755
Excuse me.

716
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:18,507
I'm so sorry for your loss.

717
01:01:20,693 --> 01:01:21,601
Thank you.

718
01:01:21,683 --> 01:01:23,415
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

719
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:26,591
Gil Colson is missing.

720
01:01:26,673 --> 01:01:27,952
What?

721
01:01:28,034 --> 01:01:30,302
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

722
01:01:30,385 --> 01:01:31,416
Christ, not again.

723
01:01:31,499 --> 01:01:33,561
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

724
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,850
You got people looking for him, Jim?

725
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,778
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

726
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:41,768
What'd his wife say?

727
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:43,047
She hadn't heard from him.

728
01:02:36,823 --> 01:02:37,731
Get out of the car!

729
01:02:38,474 --> 01:02:40,659
Get out of the car and show your hands!

730
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:43,258
Get out!

731
01:02:53,526 --> 01:02:54,804
Get 'em up!

732
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:56,619
Get out! Show 'em!

733
01:03:01,032 --> 01:03:02,599
Christ, it's Colson.

734
01:03:02,682 --> 01:03:04,373
There's a bomb around his neck!

735
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:20,788
Let's clear this place out now!

736
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:22,479
We've got to get this place cleared out!

737
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:59,061
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

738
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:03,433
We don't know if he's in on it.

739
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:07,846
What's he looking at?

740
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:27,725
Holy shit.

741
01:04:28,756 --> 01:04:30,405
Are you kidding me?

742
01:04:30,488 --> 01:04:33,210
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

743
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:36,468
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

744
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:53,254
Please.

745
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,141
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

746
01:04:56,553 --> 01:04:58,740
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

747
01:04:58,822 --> 01:04:59,811
I'm so sorry.

748
01:05:00,432 --> 01:05:02,081
Looks like a combination lock.

749
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,607
Can't we just cut it off?

750
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,999
Not if you want to keep your head.

751
01:05:42,294 --> 01:05:43,531
<i>You came.</i>

752
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:46,543
Who are you?

753
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:48,069
<i>Me?</i>

754
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:52,028
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

755
01:05:53,472 --> 01:05:55,864
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

756
01:05:55,946 --> 01:06:00,194
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

757
01:06:00,855 --> 01:06:01,928
"Unmask"?

758
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,165
<i>Yes.</i>

759
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:06,794
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

760
01:06:06,877 --> 01:06:09,269
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

761
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:12,238
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

762
01:06:12,445 --> 01:06:14,219
How am I a part of this?

763
01:06:14,302 --> 01:06:16,199
<i>You'll see.</i>

764
01:06:16,281 --> 01:06:18,014
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

765
01:06:18,096 --> 01:06:20,158
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

766
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:21,478
<i>We're live.</i>

767
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:24,530
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

768
01:06:25,726 --> 01:06:26,881
<i>At the moment,</i>

769
01:06:26,964 --> 01:06:30,304
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

770
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:31,417
<i>is dead.</i>

771
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,480
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

772
01:06:33,562 --> 01:06:34,510
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

773
01:06:34,594 --> 01:06:37,687
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

774
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:40,738
<i>You hear me?</i>

775
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:41,811
Okay.

776
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:52,534
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

777
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:56,410
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

778
01:06:58,432 --> 01:06:59,463
<i>Now,</i>

779
01:07:00,453 --> 01:07:03,216
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

780
01:07:03,299 --> 01:07:06,846
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

781
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,815
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

782
01:07:09,897 --> 01:07:13,197
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

783
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:18,435
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

784
01:07:18,517 --> 01:07:20,744
You want me to do puzzles?

785
01:07:20,827 --> 01:07:23,549
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

786
01:07:23,631 --> 01:07:27,673
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

787
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:30,065
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

788
01:07:30,148 --> 01:07:32,292
Okay, okay. So I just...

789
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:33,447
You want me to...

790
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:35,880
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

791
01:07:35,963 --> 01:07:39,551
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

792
01:07:39,634 --> 01:07:44,252
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

793
01:07:44,336 --> 01:07:46,728
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

794
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,882
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

795
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:49,367
- "Justice."
- Huh?

796
01:07:49,449 --> 01:07:50,480
The answer's "justice."

797
01:07:50,563 --> 01:07:51,759
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

798
01:07:51,841 --> 01:07:53,408
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

799
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:57,780
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

800
01:07:57,863 --> 01:08:00,213
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

801
01:08:00,296 --> 01:08:02,647
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

802
01:08:02,729 --> 01:08:03,925
Of course, of course. Of course.

803
01:08:04,008 --> 01:08:06,359
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

804
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:10,524
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

805
01:08:10,607 --> 01:08:14,732
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

806
01:08:14,814 --> 01:08:16,587
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

807
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,907
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

808
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,134
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

809
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:22,650
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

810
01:08:22,732 --> 01:08:23,969
- How much?
- Nothing!

811
01:08:24,052 --> 01:08:26,238
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

812
01:08:26,321 --> 01:08:28,589
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

813
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:29,496
What cases?

814
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:30,692
He didn't ask me that!

815
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:31,764
Come on! Ten grand.

816
01:08:32,218 --> 01:08:35,146
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

817
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:37,827
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

818
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:41,704
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

819
01:08:41,786 --> 01:08:44,178
<i>Last riddle.</i>

820
01:08:44,261 --> 01:08:48,550
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

821
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:53,006
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

822
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:55,151
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

823
01:08:55,233 --> 01:08:57,748
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

824
01:08:57,832 --> 01:08:59,605
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

825
01:08:59,688 --> 01:09:00,883
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

826
01:09:00,966 --> 01:09:02,616
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

827
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:04,637
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

828
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,245
If I go out this way, it's just me.

829
01:09:06,328 --> 01:09:09,421
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

830
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,947
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

831
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:12,349
- People are watching.
- What people?

832
01:09:12,432 --> 01:09:14,535
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

833
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:16,762
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

834
01:09:16,844 --> 01:09:17,710
<i>Four!</i>

835
01:09:17,793 --> 01:09:19,154
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

836
01:09:19,236 --> 01:09:21,092
<i>Goodbye!</i>

837
01:09:51,077 --> 01:09:52,439
Who do you think he is under there?

838
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,346
Take it easy.

839
01:09:53,429 --> 01:09:54,418
I want to see.

840
01:09:55,738 --> 01:09:56,934
What is that thing? Leather?

841
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:02,089
What's he got on his eyes?

842
01:10:02,172 --> 01:10:03,615
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

843
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:04,893
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

844
01:10:04,976 --> 01:10:06,131
Hey!

845
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:09,802
Hey! Hey! Hey!

846
01:10:09,884 --> 01:10:11,533
Relax, God damn it!

847
01:10:11,616 --> 01:10:13,101
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

848
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:16,894
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

849
01:10:16,976 --> 01:10:19,368
Colson's blood is on his hands.

850
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:20,854
Maybe it's on yours.

851
01:10:22,296 --> 01:10:23,328
What'd you say?

852
01:10:23,411 --> 01:10:24,978
He would rather die than talk.

853
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,040
What was he afraid of?

854
01:10:27,782 --> 01:10:28,854
You?

855
01:10:35,907 --> 01:10:37,309
You son of a bitch.

856
01:10:37,886 --> 01:10:40,856
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

857
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:42,630
You could be an accessory to murder.

858
01:10:42,712 --> 01:10:43,702
Why are we playing games...

859
01:10:45,805 --> 01:10:46,671
Get him! Come on!

860
01:10:46,754 --> 01:10:48,734
Back off! Back off!

861
01:10:48,816 --> 01:10:51,085
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

862
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:53,229
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

863
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:56,075
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

864
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:00,365
You too now?

865
01:11:00,448 --> 01:11:02,964
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

866
01:11:03,046 --> 01:11:05,603
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

867
01:11:05,686 --> 01:11:07,913
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

868
01:11:10,676 --> 01:11:12,161
Okay, give him the room.

869
01:11:27,627 --> 01:11:28,905
Two minutes.

870
01:11:40,536 --> 01:11:42,103
You listen to me.

871
01:11:43,671 --> 01:11:45,650
We gotta get you out of here.

872
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,239
That would put a lot of heat on you.

873
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:50,970
Well, you punched me in the face.

874
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:54,477
Take this key.

875
01:11:55,755 --> 01:11:59,095
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

876
01:12:00,127 --> 01:12:01,818
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

877
01:12:02,808 --> 01:12:05,076
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

878
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:10,892
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

879
01:12:14,274 --> 01:12:16,955
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

880
01:12:17,037 --> 01:12:19,925
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

881
01:12:20,832 --> 01:12:23,430
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

882
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,049
Or he moonlights as a cop.

883
01:12:32,586 --> 01:12:34,071
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

884
01:12:34,153 --> 01:12:35,638
Somebody stop him!

885
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:14,943
- There he is!
- Freeze!

886
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:02,702
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

887
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:04,434
I did.

888
01:14:04,517 --> 01:14:07,857
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

889
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,960
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

890
01:14:10,043 --> 01:14:11,157
I only trust you.

891
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:13,549
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

892
01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:16,972
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

893
01:14:17,715 --> 01:14:18,828
You think Penguin's the rat?

894
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,921
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

895
01:14:22,128 --> 01:14:24,067
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

896
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:25,469
DA was a regular too.

897
01:14:25,552 --> 01:14:29,016
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

898
01:14:30,088 --> 01:14:31,285
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

899
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:32,315
The what?

900
01:14:32,398 --> 01:14:33,841
Riddler's latest.

901
01:14:33,924 --> 01:14:35,615
The cipher in the maze.

902
01:14:35,697 --> 01:14:38,172
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

903
01:14:39,739 --> 01:14:41,347
A penguin's got wings too.

904
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,266
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

905
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:46,998
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

906
01:14:47,081 --> 01:14:50,256
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

907
01:14:50,464 --> 01:14:53,598
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

908
01:14:56,196 --> 01:14:58,011
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

909
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:00,239
There's Penguin.

910
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:02,177
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

911
01:15:03,786 --> 01:15:05,023
<i>You want to move in?</i>

912
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,322
<i>Let's follow.</i>

913
01:15:26,634 --> 01:15:30,139
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

914
01:15:30,263 --> 01:15:31,501
<i>I'm here.</i>

915
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,552
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

916
01:15:34,635 --> 01:15:37,109
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

917
01:15:56,123 --> 01:15:58,639
It's a drug lab. Drops.

918
01:15:58,721 --> 01:15:59,917
This is a buy.

919
01:15:59,999 --> 01:16:03,134
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

920
01:16:03,216 --> 01:16:04,371
Or they never shut it down at all.

921
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:05,320
<i>What are you saying?</i>

922
01:16:05,402 --> 01:16:08,495
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

923
01:16:32,581 --> 01:16:33,984
This just got complicated.

924
01:16:34,726 --> 01:16:35,880
What do you mean?

925
01:16:41,737 --> 01:16:43,181
Hey! What happened?

926
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:44,583
You all right?

927
01:16:55,182 --> 01:16:56,955
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

928
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,688
Jesus.

929
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,245
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

930
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,060
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

931
01:17:03,143 --> 01:17:04,834
Is that why you work in the club?

932
01:17:05,575 --> 01:17:06,607
It was all just a score?

933
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:10,442
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

934
01:17:11,803 --> 01:17:13,700
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

935
01:17:24,877 --> 01:17:25,826
Jesus!

936
01:17:54,118 --> 01:17:55,232
Hey, Vengeance!

937
01:17:57,377 --> 01:18:00,057
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

938
01:18:40,475 --> 01:18:42,084
Kenzie! Get the money!

939
01:18:47,446 --> 01:18:48,683
Hey! What the...

940
01:19:38,877 --> 01:19:40,197
Whoa!

941
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:44,940
Come on! Come on!

942
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:49,394
This guy's crazy!

943
01:19:51,126 --> 01:19:52,817
Come on! Hey!

944
01:20:41,731 --> 01:20:42,721
Move!

945
01:21:47,063 --> 01:21:48,919
Get out of the way!

946
01:22:00,056 --> 01:22:01,128
Come on!

947
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:10,861
Get out of the way!

948
01:22:47,816 --> 01:22:49,837
I got you!

949
01:22:51,074 --> 01:22:52,394
I got you!

950
01:22:52,477 --> 01:22:54,786
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

951
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,312
I got you!

952
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,715
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

953
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:47,396
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

954
01:24:47,478 --> 01:24:48,757
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

955
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:50,241
Cops caught you doing something.

956
01:24:50,324 --> 01:24:51,932
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

957
01:24:52,015 --> 01:24:53,871
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

958
01:24:53,953 --> 01:24:56,056
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

959
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,335
His drops operation.

960
01:24:57,418 --> 01:24:59,851
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

961
01:24:59,934 --> 01:25:03,522
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

962
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:05,337
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

963
01:25:05,419 --> 01:25:07,729
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

964
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:10,987
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

965
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:12,224
What are you, crazy?

966
01:25:12,306 --> 01:25:13,379
That why you killed the girl?

967
01:25:13,461 --> 01:25:14,410
I didn't kill no girl!

968
01:25:14,492 --> 01:25:16,265
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

969
01:25:16,349 --> 01:25:17,627
But she got too close, right?

970
01:25:17,709 --> 01:25:19,895
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

971
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:21,916
But somehow Riddler found out too.

972
01:25:21,999 --> 01:25:23,895
He knows so much about you.

973
01:25:23,978 --> 01:25:26,000
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

974
01:25:26,577 --> 01:25:28,762
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

975
01:25:29,175 --> 01:25:30,330
Why don't you start harmonizing?

976
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:33,299
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

977
01:25:33,381 --> 01:25:34,701
I ain't no rat!

978
01:25:34,783 --> 01:25:36,599
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

979
01:25:36,681 --> 01:25:37,753
if he heard this kind of talk?

980
01:25:37,836 --> 01:25:39,981
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

981
01:25:40,063 --> 01:25:42,579
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

982
01:25:42,662 --> 01:25:44,187
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

983
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:45,878
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

984
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,858
Open your eyes!

985
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:53,302
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

986
01:25:53,385 --> 01:25:54,869
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

987
01:25:54,952 --> 01:25:56,766
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

988
01:25:56,848 --> 01:25:59,158
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

989
01:25:59,241 --> 01:26:01,798
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

990
01:26:02,006 --> 01:26:03,366
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

991
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:04,645
Why, you got something to tell us?

992
01:26:04,728 --> 01:26:05,594
Yeah!

993
01:26:06,254 --> 01:26:07,285
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

994
01:26:07,367 --> 01:26:08,192
What?

995
01:26:08,604 --> 01:26:09,924
It's <i>"La."</i>

996
01:26:10,006 --> 01:26:11,285
<i>"La" rata.</i>

997
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,760
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

998
01:26:13,842 --> 01:26:15,698
Jesus! Look at you two.

999
01:26:16,111 --> 01:26:18,337
World's greatest detectives!

1000
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,018
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

1001
01:26:21,101 --> 01:26:22,173
Jesus!

1002
01:26:22,256 --> 01:26:23,740
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

1003
01:26:23,823 --> 01:26:25,803
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1004
01:26:27,205 --> 01:26:28,277
You think he made a mistake?

1005
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,556
He doesn't make mistakes.

1006
01:26:29,638 --> 01:26:30,669
A rat with wings?

1007
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,320
You know what that sounds like to me?

1008
01:26:32,402 --> 01:26:35,536
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1009
01:26:35,618 --> 01:26:37,598
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1010
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:47,002
"You are <i>el."</i>

1011
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,065
Maybe it was a mistake.

1012
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:58,302
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1013
01:26:58,384 --> 01:26:59,209
Wait.

1014
01:27:02,591 --> 01:27:03,911
Is that him?

1015
01:27:04,777 --> 01:27:06,592
Holy shit.

1016
01:27:26,265 --> 01:27:27,832
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1017
01:27:57,033 --> 01:28:00,622
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1018
01:28:00,704 --> 01:28:03,509
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1019
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:05,489
I'll never know where I come from.

1020
01:28:06,354 --> 01:28:07,674
Do you know what I am?"

1021
01:28:07,757 --> 01:28:08,747
Any idea?

1022
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:10,273
Yeah.

1023
01:28:11,675 --> 01:28:12,912
It's an orphan.

1024
01:28:21,697 --> 01:28:23,429
A mansion in a slum.

1025
01:28:24,955 --> 01:28:27,512
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1026
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:29,285
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1027
01:28:30,154 --> 01:28:32,227
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1028
01:28:32,318 --> 01:28:33,143
Let's go.

1029
01:28:35,721 --> 01:28:38,154
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1030
01:28:39,185 --> 01:28:40,546
You gonna untie me?

1031
01:28:40,628 --> 01:28:42,072
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1032
01:28:45,948 --> 01:28:46,938
Hey!

1033
01:28:48,382 --> 01:28:50,774
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1034
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:06,859
No guns.

1035
01:29:08,177 --> 01:29:10,198
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1036
01:29:31,068 --> 01:29:32,263
What's that?

1037
01:29:42,657 --> 01:29:44,554
Hey! Hey!

1038
01:29:50,947 --> 01:29:52,142
Dropheads.

1039
01:29:59,484 --> 01:30:01,092
What the hell is that?

1040
01:30:12,848 --> 01:30:15,198
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1041
01:30:15,281 --> 01:30:16,560
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1042
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:21,302
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

1043
01:30:21,715 --> 01:30:23,282
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1044
01:30:25,015 --> 01:30:26,582
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1045
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:29,633
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1046
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:34,253
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

1047
01:30:34,789 --> 01:30:36,562
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1048
01:30:36,645 --> 01:30:39,450
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

1049
01:30:39,532 --> 01:30:42,831
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1050
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:45,223
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1051
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:48,069
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

1052
01:30:48,523 --> 01:30:51,328
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

1053
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:55,906
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

1054
01:30:55,988 --> 01:30:57,886
<i>who need it now,</i>

1055
01:30:58,093 --> 01:30:59,536
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1056
01:30:59,618 --> 01:31:01,021
"Sins of the father."

1057
01:31:01,104 --> 01:31:03,536
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

1058
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:08,032
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1059
01:31:11,868 --> 01:31:14,054
Shall be visited upon the son.

1060
01:31:16,033 --> 01:31:19,126
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1061
01:31:23,663 --> 01:31:25,065
Hey!

1062
01:32:24,084 --> 01:32:26,600
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1063
01:32:26,683 --> 01:32:28,497
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

1064
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,188
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1065
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,910
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1066
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:46,314
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1067
01:32:47,469 --> 01:32:49,119
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:32:50,562 --> 01:32:52,294
I've been trying to reach you.

1069
01:32:55,016 --> 01:32:56,666
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1070
01:32:57,203 --> 01:33:00,914
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1071
01:33:23,392 --> 01:33:25,000
We've sedated him.

1072
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:26,691
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1073
01:33:27,682 --> 01:33:30,363
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1074
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:32,631
Is there anyone else to notify?

1075
01:33:33,951 --> 01:33:35,353
Next of kin?

1076
01:33:40,426 --> 01:33:41,498
No.

1077
01:33:42,613 --> 01:33:44,220
It's just me.

1078
01:35:26,298 --> 01:35:27,535
Selina?

1079
01:35:34,093 --> 01:35:35,083
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1080
01:35:38,176 --> 01:35:40,568
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1081
01:35:41,559 --> 01:35:42,632
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1082
01:36:01,108 --> 01:36:03,006
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1083
01:36:04,078 --> 01:36:06,511
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1084
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:09,027
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1085
01:36:09,687 --> 01:36:11,419
How could they do that to her?

1086
01:36:11,501 --> 01:36:13,440
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1087
01:36:13,522 --> 01:36:15,420
Her body was in his car.

1088
01:36:15,502 --> 01:36:18,348
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1089
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:21,399
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1090
01:36:21,483 --> 01:36:23,008
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1091
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:24,699
She didn't know any better.

1092
01:36:24,782 --> 01:36:26,101
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1093
01:36:26,184 --> 01:36:27,710
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1094
01:36:27,792 --> 01:36:29,278
It means your choices have consequences.

1095
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,711
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1096
01:36:31,793 --> 01:36:34,474
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1097
01:36:34,556 --> 01:36:36,372
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1098
01:36:36,701 --> 01:36:38,846
Compromising yourself for money?

1099
01:36:40,082 --> 01:36:42,309
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1100
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:47,297
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1101
01:36:47,379 --> 01:36:48,699
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1102
01:36:48,781 --> 01:36:50,101
Falcone owes me that money.

1103
01:36:50,183 --> 01:36:51,916
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1104
01:36:51,998 --> 01:36:52,824
Oh, really? Why's that?

1105
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:53,813
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1106
01:36:53,896 --> 01:36:55,628
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1107
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,700
would owe you anything.

1108
01:36:56,783 --> 01:36:59,092
Because he's my father!

1109
01:37:07,999 --> 01:37:10,763
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1110
01:37:12,122 --> 01:37:13,401
Just like Anni.

1111
01:37:15,545 --> 01:37:18,061
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1112
01:37:19,999 --> 01:37:21,319
To the club?

1113
01:37:22,226 --> 01:37:23,215
Yeah.

1114
01:37:25,896 --> 01:37:28,742
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1115
01:37:29,196 --> 01:37:30,928
Used to see him there.

1116
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:33,650
He scared the shit out of me.

1117
01:37:35,589 --> 01:37:39,011
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1118
01:37:39,423 --> 01:37:43,217
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1119
01:37:46,558 --> 01:37:48,868
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1120
01:37:49,402 --> 01:37:50,887
Strangled.

1121
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:54,723
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1122
01:37:56,578 --> 01:37:58,641
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1123
01:37:58,723 --> 01:38:00,868
and he didn't say a thing.

1124
01:38:02,557 --> 01:38:04,331
Couldn't even look at me.

1125
01:38:08,042 --> 01:38:09,775
He owes me that money.

1126
01:38:11,549 --> 01:38:12,951
I'm sorry.

1127
01:38:14,064 --> 01:38:15,219
For what I said.

1128
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:17,982
Oh, it's all right.

1129
01:38:21,488 --> 01:38:23,550
You assume the worst in people.

1130
01:38:24,332 --> 01:38:25,694
Which, well...

1131
01:38:27,962 --> 01:38:29,859
maybe we're not so different after all.

1132
01:38:35,262 --> 01:38:36,994
Who are you under there?

1133
01:38:43,015 --> 01:38:44,871
What are you hiding?

1134
01:38:47,098 --> 01:38:48,912
Are you just...

1135
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,171
hideously scarred?

1136
01:38:54,274 --> 01:38:55,264
Yeah.

1137
01:39:02,315 --> 01:39:03,717
Listen to me.

1138
01:39:05,243 --> 01:39:08,088
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1139
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:13,737
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1140
01:39:14,356 --> 01:39:17,408
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1141
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:18,728
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1142
01:39:18,811 --> 01:39:20,048
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1143
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:22,151
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1144
01:39:22,233 --> 01:39:23,471
I think you'd be on his side.

1145
01:39:23,554 --> 01:39:25,162
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1146
01:39:25,244 --> 01:39:27,183
What, do you live in a cave?

1147
01:39:27,266 --> 01:39:29,327
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1148
01:39:30,275 --> 01:39:34,110
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1149
01:39:34,193 --> 01:39:35,389
will you help me?

1150
01:39:36,502 --> 01:39:37,780
Please.

1151
01:39:40,543 --> 01:39:42,441
Come on, Vengeance.

1152
01:39:44,873 --> 01:39:47,101
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1153
01:39:47,183 --> 01:39:48,792
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1154
01:39:58,111 --> 01:39:59,637
I told you, baby.

1155
01:40:01,535 --> 01:40:04,092
I can take care of myself.

1156
01:40:14,648 --> 01:40:17,907
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

1157
01:40:25,535 --> 01:40:29,082
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1158
01:40:29,206 --> 01:40:31,021
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

1159
01:40:31,227 --> 01:40:33,619
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

1160
01:40:33,784 --> 01:40:35,228
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1161
01:40:35,804 --> 01:40:38,114
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1162
01:40:39,309 --> 01:40:41,619
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1163
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:44,135
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1164
01:40:44,217 --> 01:40:47,351
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1165
01:40:48,547 --> 01:40:53,165
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1166
01:40:53,249 --> 01:40:56,878
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1167
01:40:57,454 --> 01:40:58,979
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1168
01:40:59,062 --> 01:41:01,537
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1169
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,227
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1170
01:41:03,311 --> 01:41:08,836
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

1171
01:41:08,919 --> 01:41:13,538
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

1172
01:41:13,621 --> 01:41:15,972
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1173
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:19,146
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

1174
01:41:19,229 --> 01:41:23,106
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1175
01:41:23,229 --> 01:41:25,251
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1176
01:41:25,745 --> 01:41:29,993
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

1177
01:41:30,075 --> 01:41:32,632
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1178
01:41:32,756 --> 01:41:35,767
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1179
01:41:36,219 --> 01:41:41,416
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1180
01:41:41,911 --> 01:41:44,262
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1181
01:41:44,345 --> 01:41:46,695
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1182
01:41:46,777 --> 01:41:50,201
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1183
01:41:50,284 --> 01:41:53,046
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1184
01:41:54,447 --> 01:41:56,263
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1185
01:42:01,954 --> 01:42:03,026
Do you know who I am?

1186
01:42:04,509 --> 01:42:05,623
You're Bruce Wayne.

1187
01:42:05,706 --> 01:42:07,562
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1188
01:42:18,202 --> 01:42:19,192
See?

1189
01:42:30,243 --> 01:42:32,842
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1190
01:42:33,585 --> 01:42:35,688
Must have made a fortune.

1191
01:42:36,142 --> 01:42:37,874
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1192
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:41,792
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1193
01:42:41,874 --> 01:42:42,864
No, boss.

1194
01:42:42,947 --> 01:42:45,256
$1,183.

1195
01:42:45,584 --> 01:42:47,523
You know why communism failed, right?

1196
01:42:47,605 --> 01:42:48,595
No, boss.

1197
01:42:50,492 --> 01:42:51,729
Austerity.

1198
01:42:53,956 --> 01:42:55,565
All right. All right.

1199
01:42:55,729 --> 01:42:58,079
Look at that. Perfect.

1200
01:42:58,161 --> 01:42:59,894
It's never gonna be that good again.

1201
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,554
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1202
01:43:04,637 --> 01:43:05,791
What are you doing here?

1203
01:43:07,689 --> 01:43:09,503
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1204
01:43:10,411 --> 01:43:11,441
Come on.

1205
01:43:13,339 --> 01:43:14,535
See ya, champ.

1206
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,637
Come on, sweetheart.

1207
01:43:18,575 --> 01:43:19,565
Have a seat.

1208
01:43:21,586 --> 01:43:23,359
I thought I might hear from you.

1209
01:43:24,514 --> 01:43:27,608
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1210
01:43:29,009 --> 01:43:30,782
stirring things up, huh?

1211
01:43:30,864 --> 01:43:32,555
- Is it true?
- What?

1212
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:35,443
That reporter business?

1213
01:43:36,763 --> 01:43:37,958
What do you want to know here, kid?

1214
01:43:38,041 --> 01:43:40,804
Did you kill him? For my father?

1215
01:43:40,887 --> 01:43:43,609
Look, your father was in trouble.

1216
01:43:44,475 --> 01:43:46,249
This reporter had some dirt.

1217
01:43:46,331 --> 01:43:47,940
Some very...

1218
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:52,681
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1219
01:43:52,764 --> 01:43:55,445
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1220
01:43:55,527 --> 01:43:56,970
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1221
01:43:57,052 --> 01:43:58,950
not right before the election.

1222
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:01,547
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1223
01:44:01,629 --> 01:44:03,238
but he wasn't going for it.

1224
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,455
So, he came to me.

1225
01:44:06,537 --> 01:44:08,888
Well, I never seen him like that.

1226
01:44:09,588 --> 01:44:11,403
He said, "Carmine,

1227
01:44:12,187 --> 01:44:16,847
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1228
01:44:19,239 --> 01:44:22,126
And when fear isn't enough...

1229
01:44:22,786 --> 01:44:24,601
Oof. Hmm.

1230
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,220
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1231
01:44:30,209 --> 01:44:32,024
I handled it.

1232
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:34,992
I know.

1233
01:44:35,075 --> 01:44:37,302
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1234
01:44:38,414 --> 01:44:40,230
But you'd be surprised

1235
01:44:40,312 --> 01:44:42,662
what even a good man like him

1236
01:44:42,745 --> 01:44:45,302
is capable of in the right situation.

1237
01:44:47,529 --> 01:44:48,973
Do me a favor.

1238
01:44:49,302 --> 01:44:51,323
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1239
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:53,467
This reporter

1240
01:44:54,291 --> 01:44:55,859
was a lowlife.

1241
01:44:55,942 --> 01:44:57,385
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1242
01:44:58,993 --> 01:45:00,602
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1243
01:45:01,344 --> 01:45:04,562
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1244
01:45:05,964 --> 01:45:09,428
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1245
01:45:09,511 --> 01:45:11,820
that your father would be in my pocket,

1246
01:45:12,562 --> 01:45:13,552
forever.

1247
01:45:14,087 --> 01:45:16,108
He would have done anything

1248
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:18,335
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1249
01:45:18,418 --> 01:45:19,737
You understand?

1250
01:45:20,933 --> 01:45:25,429
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1251
01:45:25,512 --> 01:45:27,532
Do I know it for a fact?

1252
01:45:29,799 --> 01:45:31,862
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1253
01:45:33,097 --> 01:45:35,366
This is what you wanted, huh?

1254
01:45:35,449 --> 01:45:37,841
This little conversation here?

1255
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:42,378
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1256
01:45:44,975 --> 01:45:47,079
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1257
01:46:55,082 --> 01:46:56,361
You lied to me...

1258
01:46:59,165 --> 01:47:00,774
my whole life.

1259
01:47:05,888 --> 01:47:07,908
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1260
01:47:10,577 --> 01:47:13,835
He told me what he did for my father.

1261
01:47:17,928 --> 01:47:19,413
About Salvatore Maroni.

1262
01:47:21,392 --> 01:47:24,073
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1263
01:47:24,156 --> 01:47:25,888
Had my father killed.

1264
01:47:28,196 --> 01:47:30,382
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1265
01:47:33,105 --> 01:47:37,600
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1266
01:47:37,682 --> 01:47:39,992
believing that he was a good man.

1267
01:47:40,074 --> 01:47:41,641
He was a good man.

1268
01:47:42,796 --> 01:47:44,487
You listen to me.

1269
01:47:44,569 --> 01:47:47,952
Your father was a good man.

1270
01:47:51,415 --> 01:47:53,312
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1271
01:47:53,394 --> 01:47:55,292
He had a man killed.

1272
01:47:55,374 --> 01:47:56,447
Why?

1273
01:47:57,601 --> 01:48:00,819
To protect his family image?

1274
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:03,128
His political aspirations?

1275
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:06,716
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1276
01:48:09,148 --> 01:48:10,674
He was protecting your mother.

1277
01:48:11,622 --> 01:48:15,129
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1278
01:48:15,211 --> 01:48:17,111
He cared about her,

1279
01:48:17,272 --> 01:48:18,551
and you,

1280
01:48:18,633 --> 01:48:21,520
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1281
01:48:21,602 --> 01:48:25,026
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1282
01:48:25,892 --> 01:48:29,191
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1283
01:48:29,274 --> 01:48:32,239
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1284
01:48:32,324 --> 01:48:34,138
That's who Falcone is.

1285
01:48:36,366 --> 01:48:38,552
And that was your father's mistake.

1286
01:48:38,635 --> 01:48:40,655
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1287
01:48:40,738 --> 01:48:43,460
your father was distraught.

1288
01:48:44,325 --> 01:48:47,502
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1289
01:48:47,584 --> 01:48:49,728
that he would confess everything.

1290
01:48:51,089 --> 01:48:53,068
And that night,

1291
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:57,028
your father and your mother were killed.

1292
01:49:02,471 --> 01:49:04,204
It was Falcone?

1293
01:49:10,059 --> 01:49:12,162
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1294
01:49:16,698 --> 01:49:20,203
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1295
01:49:20,285 --> 01:49:23,008
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1296
01:49:23,091 --> 01:49:28,246
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1297
01:49:29,978 --> 01:49:33,814
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1298
01:49:34,348 --> 01:49:36,122
I know you always blamed yourself.

1299
01:49:36,204 --> 01:49:38,720
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1300
01:49:40,865 --> 01:49:43,133
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1301
01:49:44,535 --> 01:49:46,886
but I didn't know how to help.

1302
01:49:46,969 --> 01:49:49,443
I could teach you how to fight,

1303
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:53,319
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1304
01:49:53,402 --> 01:49:55,216
You needed a father.

1305
01:49:57,154 --> 01:49:59,546
And all you had was me.

1306
01:50:01,772 --> 01:50:02,968
I'm sorry.

1307
01:50:04,701 --> 01:50:06,598
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1308
01:50:13,196 --> 01:50:14,268
God.

1309
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:21,650
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1310
01:50:24,331 --> 01:50:26,434
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1311
01:50:32,661 --> 01:50:33,899
I mean,

1312
01:50:35,094 --> 01:50:37,197
I'm not afraid to die.

1313
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:41,280
I realize now there's something

1314
01:50:42,269 --> 01:50:44,125
I haven't got past.

1315
01:50:45,033 --> 01:50:46,765
This fear...

1316
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:52,127
of ever going through any of that again.

1317
01:50:56,208 --> 01:50:58,394
Of losing somebody I care about.

1318
01:51:48,047 --> 01:51:48,995
Hey.

1319
01:51:49,078 --> 01:51:51,799
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1320
01:51:51,883 --> 01:51:53,779
I thought it was you.

1321
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:07,966
- I found him!
- I see that.

1322
01:52:08,049 --> 01:52:09,533
He had my shit and my phone.

1323
01:52:09,615 --> 01:52:10,812
She left a message
the night they took her.

1324
01:52:10,894 --> 01:52:11,801
She called me...

1325
01:52:11,883 --> 01:52:13,574
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1326
01:52:13,657 --> 01:52:14,936
She got my gun!

1327
01:52:16,255 --> 01:52:17,947
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1328
01:52:19,348 --> 01:52:21,863
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1329
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,462
Here. Listen.

1330
01:52:30,276 --> 01:52:31,925
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1331
01:52:32,049 --> 01:52:34,194
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1332
01:52:34,276 --> 01:52:36,339
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1333
01:52:36,421 --> 01:52:37,741
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1334
01:52:37,823 --> 01:52:39,514
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1335
01:52:39,597 --> 01:52:40,627
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1336
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:41,989
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1337
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:44,711
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1338
01:52:46,566 --> 01:52:48,587
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1339
01:52:49,163 --> 01:52:51,679
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1340
01:52:51,762 --> 01:52:54,649
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1341
01:52:54,732 --> 01:52:57,412
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1342
01:52:57,823 --> 01:52:59,803
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1343
01:53:00,504 --> 01:53:03,350
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1344
01:53:03,432 --> 01:53:06,113
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1345
01:53:06,196 --> 01:53:08,299
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1346
01:53:08,381 --> 01:53:11,474
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1347
01:53:12,175 --> 01:53:14,691
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1348
01:53:15,763 --> 01:53:17,083
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1349
01:53:17,866 --> 01:53:21,372
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1350
01:53:21,867 --> 01:53:23,063
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1351
01:53:23,145 --> 01:53:25,083
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1352
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:26,445
<i>The deal.</i>

1353
01:53:26,527 --> 01:53:31,128
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1354
01:53:31,351 --> 01:53:34,032
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1355
01:53:34,115 --> 01:53:36,465
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1356
01:53:36,548 --> 01:53:37,662
<i>Right.</i>

1357
01:53:38,279 --> 01:53:39,640
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1358
01:53:40,589 --> 01:53:42,733
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1359
01:53:50,197 --> 01:53:51,517
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1360
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,125
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1361
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:56,219
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1362
01:54:05,333 --> 01:54:06,611
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1363
01:54:11,188 --> 01:54:12,961
A falcon has wings too.

1364
01:54:13,292 --> 01:54:15,106
Falcone is the rat?

1365
01:54:25,953 --> 01:54:29,087
Falcone works for you guys?

1366
01:54:29,623 --> 01:54:32,139
The mayor? The DA?

1367
01:54:34,983 --> 01:54:36,055
No.

1368
01:54:39,108 --> 01:54:40,386
We work for him.

1369
01:54:41,376 --> 01:54:42,613
Everybody does.

1370
01:54:42,695 --> 01:54:43,685
How?

1371
01:54:43,768 --> 01:54:45,335
Through Renewal.

1372
01:54:45,868 --> 01:54:47,229
Renewal is everything.

1373
01:54:47,312 --> 01:54:48,632
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1374
01:54:49,209 --> 01:54:52,880
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1375
01:54:52,962 --> 01:54:56,615
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1376
01:54:56,716 --> 01:55:00,058
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1377
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:02,201
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1378
01:55:02,285 --> 01:55:03,975
Everybody got a piece.

1379
01:55:04,058 --> 01:55:05,873
But Falcone wanted more.

1380
01:55:07,521 --> 01:55:10,697
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1381
01:55:12,099 --> 01:55:14,408
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1382
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:17,461
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1383
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:19,977
then install them all as his puppets.

1384
01:55:20,059 --> 01:55:22,575
You think this goddamn election matters?

1385
01:55:24,183 --> 01:55:26,081
Falcone's the mayor.

1386
01:55:26,904 --> 01:55:29,379
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1387
01:55:29,461 --> 01:55:30,822
Come on, Vengeance.

1388
01:55:31,523 --> 01:55:33,338
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1389
01:55:34,039 --> 01:55:35,647
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1390
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:36,555
No!

1391
01:55:37,874 --> 01:55:39,069
We'll get him.

1392
01:55:39,729 --> 01:55:41,585
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1393
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:42,781
He owns the city!

1394
01:55:42,863 --> 01:55:44,101
Cross that line...

1395
01:55:44,885 --> 01:55:46,163
you'll become just like him.

1396
01:55:46,864 --> 01:55:48,390
Listen to me.

1397
01:55:48,473 --> 01:55:50,329
Don't throw your life away.

1398
01:55:56,679 --> 01:55:58,040
Don't worry, honey.

1399
01:56:01,092 --> 01:56:02,535
I got nine of 'em.

1400
01:56:02,659 --> 01:56:04,598
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1401
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:07,155
Oh, God!

1402
01:56:16,352 --> 01:56:17,466
She won't get out of there alive.

1403
01:56:17,631 --> 01:56:20,188
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1404
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:21,260
I have to stop her.

1405
01:56:21,425 --> 01:56:22,373
Don't you mean "we"?

1406
01:56:23,568 --> 01:56:25,094
I gotta do this my way.

1407
01:56:25,424 --> 01:56:26,414
And then what?

1408
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:28,641
We do what Riddler said.

1409
01:56:29,341 --> 01:56:30,950
Bring the rat into the light.

1410
01:57:06,125 --> 01:57:08,147
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1411
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:09,672
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1412
01:57:10,291 --> 01:57:11,610
Tell him it's about Annika.

1413
01:57:14,828 --> 01:57:16,147
Hey!

1414
01:57:16,848 --> 01:57:18,250
Look who it is, huh?

1415
01:57:18,332 --> 01:57:20,724
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1416
01:57:20,807 --> 01:57:22,787
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1417
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:24,395
Absolutely.

1418
01:57:26,127 --> 01:57:27,117
Alone?

1419
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:44,563
Hey!

1420
01:57:54,872 --> 01:57:56,068
I'm just so worried.

1421
01:57:56,151 --> 01:57:57,759
I don't know where she is.

1422
01:57:59,241 --> 01:58:02,583
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1423
01:58:02,665 --> 01:58:06,047
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1424
01:58:07,407 --> 01:58:09,757
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1425
01:58:11,201 --> 01:58:12,314
I'm sorry.

1426
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:13,593
It's okay.

1427
01:58:13,675 --> 01:58:15,778
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1428
01:58:15,943 --> 01:58:18,789
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1429
01:58:22,871 --> 01:58:23,779
Mr. Falcone?

1430
01:58:23,861 --> 01:58:25,304
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1431
01:58:25,387 --> 01:58:28,274
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1432
01:58:30,624 --> 01:58:32,110
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1433
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,594
I'll be right back.

1434
01:58:48,605 --> 01:58:49,678
Holy shit.

1435
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,410
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

1443

1451
01:59:34,299 --> 01:59:35,536
Hey, Dad.

1452
01:59:36,568 --> 01:59:37,557
What?

1453
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:40,031
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1454
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:43,084
You remember her?

1455
01:59:44,854 --> 01:59:45,886
Yeah.

1456
01:59:50,134 --> 01:59:51,206
Just put down the gun, honey.

1457
01:59:51,289 --> 01:59:52,361
This is for my mother.

1458
02:00:48,487 --> 02:00:49,642
I see him!

1459
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:34,551
You don't think this hurts me?

1460
02:01:39,088 --> 02:01:41,357
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1461
02:01:57,316 --> 02:01:59,130
You made me do this.

1462
02:02:00,532 --> 02:02:02,305
Just like your mother.

1463
02:02:08,244 --> 02:02:09,565
He has to pay!

1464
02:02:13,442 --> 02:02:14,555
You don't have to pay with him.

1465
02:02:18,143 --> 02:02:19,628
You paid enough.

1466
02:02:53,443 --> 02:02:54,557
Jesus.

1467
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:57,176
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1468
02:02:57,277 --> 02:03:00,330
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1469
02:03:00,412 --> 02:03:01,649
I'm gonna start crying,

1470
02:03:01,732 --> 02:03:04,206
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1471
02:03:04,289 --> 02:03:05,897
Let me tell you something.

1472
02:03:05,980 --> 02:03:07,671
Whatever I know,

1473
02:03:07,753 --> 02:03:09,609
whatever I've done,

1474
02:03:09,691 --> 02:03:13,981
it's all going with me to my grave.

1475
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:26,229
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1476
02:03:27,712 --> 02:03:29,981
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1477
02:03:37,817 --> 02:03:40,126
I guess we don't all work for you.

1478
02:03:48,910 --> 02:03:50,436
You have the right to remain silent.

1479
02:03:51,261 --> 02:03:54,725
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1480
02:03:54,808 --> 02:03:56,127
You have the right to an attorney.

1481
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:57,365
If you cannot afford one,

1482
02:03:57,447 --> 02:03:59,221
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1483
02:03:59,303 --> 02:04:00,994
Do you understand these rights?

1484
02:04:02,354 --> 02:04:03,921
Do you understand?

1485
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:06,932
Yeah.

1486
02:04:07,015 --> 02:04:09,077
I'll see you when I walk out.

1487
02:04:09,159 --> 02:04:10,148
With these rights in mind,

1488
02:04:10,232 --> 02:04:11,510
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1489
02:04:11,592 --> 02:04:12,829
Goddamn rat.

1490
02:04:14,518 --> 02:04:15,837
What'd you say?

1491
02:04:15,921 --> 02:04:17,653
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1492
02:04:18,766 --> 02:04:20,003
Probably be your last.

1493
02:04:20,251 --> 02:04:23,262
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1494
02:04:23,344 --> 02:04:24,417
Maybe I am.

1495
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:25,695
Really, Oz?

1496
02:04:25,777 --> 02:04:30,438
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1497
02:04:30,521 --> 02:04:31,593
I'll spray paint your ass!

1498
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:36,707
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1499
02:04:37,161 --> 02:04:39,140
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1500
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:41,903
Get your hands off of me!

1501
02:05:00,996 --> 02:05:02,976
"Bring him into the light.

1502
02:05:06,523 --> 02:05:08,462
And you'll find where I'm at."

1503
02:05:08,544 --> 02:05:09,616
There!

1504
02:05:09,699 --> 02:05:11,513
The shots came from up there!

1505
02:05:13,081 --> 02:05:14,070
It's Riddler.

1506
02:05:16,007 --> 02:05:17,162
Gage, on me.

1507
02:05:17,245 --> 02:05:19,926
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1508
02:06:32,672 --> 02:06:33,868
He's gone.

1509
02:06:43,435 --> 02:06:45,373
He's been here this whole time.

1510
02:06:45,456 --> 02:06:47,765
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1511
02:06:47,848 --> 02:06:48,962
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1512
02:06:49,044 --> 02:06:51,683
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1513
02:06:51,766 --> 02:06:54,200
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1514
02:06:54,282 --> 02:06:57,169
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

1515
02:07:12,386 --> 02:07:14,449
Police! Hands up!

1516
02:07:17,209 --> 02:07:20,674
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1517
02:07:39,604 --> 02:07:41,502
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1518
02:07:44,305 --> 02:07:45,583
Stay still!

1519
02:07:45,665 --> 02:07:46,655
Now!

1520
02:08:14,739 --> 02:08:16,512
Which one is you?

1521
02:08:16,595 --> 02:08:18,080
You tell me.

1522
02:08:18,904 --> 02:08:20,348
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1523
02:08:23,401 --> 02:08:25,132
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1524
02:08:39,235 --> 02:08:42,123
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1525
02:08:42,205 --> 02:08:44,762
<i>have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.</i>

1526
02:08:44,844 --> 02:08:47,401
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Reál's headquarters right now...</i>

1527
02:08:47,484 --> 02:08:48,514
Hey.

1528
02:09:12,433 --> 02:09:14,124
What are all these diaries?

1529
02:09:14,207 --> 02:09:16,599
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1530
02:09:16,681 --> 02:09:20,187
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1531
02:09:20,269 --> 02:09:21,795
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1532
02:09:21,878 --> 02:09:24,146
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1533
02:09:24,229 --> 02:09:25,885
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1534
02:09:26,001 --> 02:09:28,393
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1535
02:09:28,475 --> 02:09:30,208
What about chain of evidence?

1536
02:09:31,032 --> 02:09:32,229
You should see this.

1537
02:09:38,126 --> 02:09:39,611
He's wearing gloves.

1538
02:09:41,054 --> 02:09:43,281
"Friday, July 16th.

1539
02:09:43,364 --> 02:09:47,035
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1540
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:50,250
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1541
02:09:50,333 --> 02:09:51,735
But then, today, I saw it.

1542
02:09:51,817 --> 02:09:55,900
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1543
02:09:57,220 --> 02:09:58,993
'Renewal.'

1544
02:09:59,076 --> 02:10:03,448
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1545
02:10:03,530 --> 02:10:06,623
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1546
02:10:06,706 --> 02:10:10,006
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1547
02:10:10,088 --> 02:10:12,522
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1548
02:10:12,604 --> 02:10:16,623
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1549
02:10:16,812 --> 02:10:18,626
"If you want people to understand,

1550
02:10:18,709 --> 02:10:20,524
really understand,

1551
02:10:20,606 --> 02:10:22,874
you can't just give them the answers.

1552
02:10:22,957 --> 02:10:24,401
You have to confront them,

1553
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:26,875
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1554
02:10:26,958 --> 02:10:29,102
just like they tortured me.

1555
02:10:29,185 --> 02:10:31,948
I know now what I must become."

1556
02:10:34,877 --> 02:10:36,196
Jesus.

1557
02:10:42,218 --> 02:10:44,156
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1558
02:10:44,692 --> 02:10:46,177
This one's not a rat.

1559
02:11:02,633 --> 02:11:03,746
What is that?

1560
02:11:35,133 --> 02:11:36,330
Some kind of pry tool?

1561
02:11:36,412 --> 02:11:37,774
Is it a chisel?

1562
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:39,299
It's a murder weapon.

1563
02:11:39,381 --> 02:11:40,743
He killed Mitchell with it.

1564
02:11:41,403 --> 02:11:44,248
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1565
02:11:52,745 --> 02:11:54,724
"My confession"?

1566
02:11:54,806 --> 02:11:57,652
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1567
02:11:57,735 --> 02:11:59,096
This isn't over.

1568
02:11:59,178 --> 02:12:01,570
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1569
02:12:01,983 --> 02:12:04,169
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1570
02:12:11,670 --> 02:12:14,356
His final post was last night.

1571
02:12:14,438 --> 02:12:17,614
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1572
02:12:17,696 --> 02:12:20,665
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1573
02:12:20,790 --> 02:12:24,172
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1574
02:12:35,389 --> 02:12:37,906
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1575
02:12:39,514 --> 02:12:41,205
"The Truth Unmasked."

1576
02:12:42,029 --> 02:12:43,638
I think I'm his last target.

1577
02:12:46,195 --> 02:12:47,267
You?

1578
02:12:47,639 --> 02:12:49,659
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1579
02:12:50,196 --> 02:12:51,557
What is?

1580
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:53,413
The Batman.

1581
02:12:58,733 --> 02:12:59,888
Yeah?

1582
02:13:11,065 --> 02:13:12,261
Right.

1583
02:13:15,107 --> 02:13:19,025
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1584
02:13:26,408 --> 02:13:27,892
You're a good cop.

1585
02:13:52,225 --> 02:13:54,576
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1586
02:13:55,318 --> 02:13:57,133
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1587
02:13:57,216 --> 02:13:58,742
"Want"?

1588
02:13:59,319 --> 02:14:02,908
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

1589
02:14:04,103 --> 02:14:05,423
<i>For this moment.</i>

1590
02:14:06,454 --> 02:14:09,423
I've been invisible my whole life.

1591
02:14:10,621 --> 02:14:13,219
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1592
02:14:14,746 --> 02:14:17,138
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1593
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:19,034
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1594
02:14:29,304 --> 02:14:31,242
<i>Bruce...</i>

1595
02:14:34,088 --> 02:14:35,903
<i>Wayne.</i>

1596
02:14:38,253 --> 02:14:41,965
Bruce...

1597
02:14:43,368 --> 02:14:46,213
<i>Wayne.</i>

1598
02:14:57,349 --> 02:14:59,742
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1599
02:15:02,298 --> 02:15:05,639
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

1600
02:15:05,721 --> 02:15:08,073
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1601
02:15:10,505 --> 02:15:14,713
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

1602
02:15:15,249 --> 02:15:18,754
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1603
02:15:18,837 --> 02:15:22,466
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1604
02:15:23,044 --> 02:15:24,570
<i>Orphan.</i>

1605
02:15:30,178 --> 02:15:35,251
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

1606
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:41,108
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

1607
02:15:41,768 --> 02:15:43,294
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1608
02:15:45,892 --> 02:15:48,532
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1609
02:15:48,903 --> 02:15:51,460
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1610
02:15:52,739 --> 02:15:56,740
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

1611
02:15:58,430 --> 02:16:03,049
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

1612
02:16:04,329 --> 02:16:07,464
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1613
02:16:07,546 --> 02:16:09,814
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1614
02:16:11,093 --> 02:16:13,650
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1615
02:16:16,537 --> 02:16:19,671
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

1616
02:16:19,754 --> 02:16:22,641
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

1617
02:16:22,724 --> 02:16:23,714
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1618
02:16:25,156 --> 02:16:27,177
<i>Bruce...</i>

1619
02:16:28,209 --> 02:16:30,105
<i>Wayne.</i>

1620
02:16:33,735 --> 02:16:36,787
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1621
02:16:40,169 --> 02:16:43,262
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1622
02:16:44,706 --> 02:16:48,541
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1623
02:16:51,676 --> 02:16:52,831
<i>God.</i>

1624
02:16:53,821 --> 02:16:55,099
<i>Look at you.</i>

1625
02:16:56,749 --> 02:16:59,182
Your mask is amazing.

1626
02:16:59,264 --> 02:17:02,152
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1627
02:17:02,234 --> 02:17:03,424
Ain't it funny?

1628
02:17:03,514 --> 02:17:07,886
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

1629
02:17:09,329 --> 02:17:11,350
<i>You and I both know</i>

1630
02:17:12,299 --> 02:17:14,773
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1631
02:17:14,856 --> 02:17:18,444
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1632
02:17:18,526 --> 02:17:20,052
<i>No shame,</i>

1633
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:21,950
<i>no limits.</i>

1634
02:17:22,032 --> 02:17:23,682
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1635
02:17:24,548 --> 02:17:25,537
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1636
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:27,311
<i>All those cards.</i>

1637
02:17:27,393 --> 02:17:28,590
<i>I told you,</i>

1638
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:31,188
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

1639
02:17:31,271 --> 02:17:33,456
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1640
02:17:33,539 --> 02:17:34,983
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1641
02:17:35,065 --> 02:17:37,044
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

1642
02:17:37,127 --> 02:17:38,282
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1643
02:17:38,365 --> 02:17:39,354
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1644
02:17:39,436 --> 02:17:41,912
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1645
02:17:41,994 --> 02:17:44,386
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

1646
02:17:44,469 --> 02:17:47,602
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

1647
02:17:47,685 --> 02:17:49,293
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1648
02:17:49,376 --> 02:17:50,572
You gave me that.

1649
02:17:50,655 --> 02:17:51,768
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1650
02:17:51,850 --> 02:17:54,408
You showed me what was possible.

1651
02:17:54,491 --> 02:17:59,316
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

1652
02:17:59,398 --> 02:18:00,924
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1653
02:18:01,007 --> 02:18:02,491
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1654
02:18:03,605 --> 02:18:04,678
<i>What?</i>

1655
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:06,905
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1656
02:18:06,987 --> 02:18:08,348
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1657
02:18:08,430 --> 02:18:09,916
You think you'll be remembered?

1658
02:18:09,998 --> 02:18:11,647
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1659
02:18:12,142 --> 02:18:13,875
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

1660
02:18:13,957 --> 02:18:15,606
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

1661
02:18:15,689 --> 02:18:16,720
<i>No, no!</i>

1662
02:18:16,803 --> 02:18:17,710
<i>A nobody!</i>

1663
02:18:19,484 --> 02:18:21,257
<i>No!</i>

1664
02:18:23,154 --> 02:18:25,505
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1665
02:18:25,753 --> 02:18:28,310
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

1666
02:18:29,258 --> 02:18:32,846
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1667
02:18:32,929 --> 02:18:35,527
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1668
02:18:36,641 --> 02:18:38,621
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1669
02:18:38,993 --> 02:18:42,251
We could watch the whole thing together.

1670
02:18:42,333 --> 02:18:43,323
<i>Watch what?</i>

1671
02:18:43,406 --> 02:18:45,137
<i>Everything!</i>

1672
02:18:53,386 --> 02:18:55,036
<i>It was all there.</i>

1673
02:18:57,181 --> 02:18:59,491
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1674
02:19:03,739 --> 02:19:07,615
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

1675
02:19:09,636 --> 02:19:11,699
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1676
02:19:12,152 --> 02:19:13,390
<i>What have you done?</i>

1677
02:19:14,091 --> 02:19:18,916
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1678
02:19:21,721 --> 02:19:23,535
<i>You.</i>

1679
02:19:25,185 --> 02:19:27,288
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

1680
02:19:28,608 --> 02:19:30,134
<i>What have you done?</i>

1681
02:19:31,659 --> 02:19:37,434
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1682
02:19:37,847 --> 02:19:39,703
<i>What have you done?</i>

1683
02:19:42,135 --> 02:19:43,497
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1684
02:19:43,662 --> 02:19:45,064
<i>What have you done?</i>

1685
02:19:49,024 --> 02:19:52,513
<i>Maria</i>

1686
02:19:52,654 --> 02:19:58,139
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1687
02:20:29,649 --> 02:20:31,010
Hey!

1688
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,279
What are you doing in here?

1689
02:20:51,012 --> 02:20:53,570
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1690
02:21:00,086 --> 02:21:02,520
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1691
02:21:03,386 --> 02:21:06,108
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1692
02:21:10,727 --> 02:21:13,738
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

1693
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:15,965
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1694
02:21:16,047 --> 02:21:18,274
It's a tucker.

1695
02:21:35,885 --> 02:21:36,875
Huh.

1696
02:21:51,887 --> 02:21:54,650
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1697
02:21:54,733 --> 02:21:56,218
What are you doing?

1698
02:22:26,533 --> 02:22:27,935
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1699
02:22:28,264 --> 02:22:30,451
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

1713

<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

1714
02:23:17,839 --> 02:23:20,767
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

1715
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:24,644
<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

1716
02:23:24,726 --> 02:23:28,520

<i>for retribution.</i>

1720
02:23:40,730 --> 02:23:43,493
<i>I've parked seven vans</i>

Boom!

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:33,603
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

02:25:51,265 --> 02:25:53,287
I can't get through! The lines are down.

1751
02:25:58,854 --> 02:26:00,999
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1752
02:26:01,576 --> 02:26:03,185
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

1753
02:26:03,267 --> 02:26:06,113
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1754
02:26:06,195 --> 02:26:08,134
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

1755
02:26:17,661 --> 02:26:19,311
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

1756
02:26:19,393 --> 02:26:20,877
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1757
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:22,775
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1758
02:26:22,857 --> 02:26:24,173
We got an active situation.

1759
02:26:24,344 --> 02:26:25,622
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1760
02:26:25,704 --> 02:26:26,901
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

1761
02:26:26,983 --> 02:26:27,890
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

1762
02:26:27,973 --> 02:26:28,797
Come!

1763
02:27:04,431 --> 02:27:05,833
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

1764
02:27:05,916 --> 02:27:06,783
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1765
02:27:06,865 --> 02:27:08,226
The water's already started to breach.

1766
02:27:08,308 --> 02:27:09,834
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1767
02:27:09,917 --> 02:27:12,103
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1768
02:27:12,186 --> 02:27:14,000
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1769
02:27:14,082 --> 02:27:16,392
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1770
02:27:16,474 --> 02:27:18,701
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1771
02:27:18,784 --> 02:27:21,011
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1772
02:27:21,094 --> 02:27:22,909
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1773
02:27:22,991 --> 02:27:25,960
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1774
02:27:26,043 --> 02:27:27,528
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1775
02:27:32,517 --> 02:27:35,940
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1776
02:27:36,022 --> 02:27:38,291
Please! I just need your attention!

1777
02:27:54,004 --> 02:27:55,118
You're okay!

1778
02:29:25,402 --> 02:29:28,001
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1779
02:29:28,083 --> 02:29:29,279
Follow me, sir.

1780
02:31:37,834 --> 02:31:39,318
No, no. It's okay.

1781
02:31:39,401 --> 02:31:40,432
It's okay.

1782
02:31:41,586 --> 02:31:42,618
It's okay.

1783
02:31:44,227 --> 02:31:46,330
It's done now. It's done.

1784
02:31:49,011 --> 02:31:50,331
It's over.

1785
02:32:45,804 --> 02:32:49,228
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1786
02:32:49,929 --> 02:32:52,239
Take it easy. Easy.

1787
02:33:20,490 --> 02:33:21,603
Jesus.

1788
02:33:31,337 --> 02:33:32,986
Who the hell are you?

1789
02:33:37,152 --> 02:33:38,142
Me?

1790
02:33:41,276 --> 02:33:42,679
I'm Vengeance.

1791
02:37:13,020 --> 02:37:15,288
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1792
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:20,320
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1793
02:37:22,629 --> 02:37:24,362
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1794
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:28,610
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1795
02:37:29,518 --> 02:37:31,126
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1796
02:37:34,302 --> 02:37:37,972
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1797
02:37:38,054 --> 02:37:40,571
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>

1798
02:37:41,725 --> 02:37:45,395
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1799
02:37:48,324 --> 02:37:51,418
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1800
02:37:52,778 --> 02:37:54,140
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1801
02:37:54,758 --> 02:37:56,202
But not just our city.

1802
02:37:56,903 --> 02:38:01,069
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1803
02:38:01,151 --> 02:38:03,213
in our elected officials,

1804
02:38:03,296 --> 02:38:04,574
in each other.

1805
02:38:05,357 --> 02:38:08,657
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1806
02:38:12,947 --> 02:38:14,596
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1807
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:18,184
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1808
02:38:20,246 --> 02:38:22,144
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1809
02:38:24,619 --> 02:38:27,630
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1810
02:38:28,949 --> 02:38:31,301
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1811
02:38:33,693 --> 02:38:35,714
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1812
02:38:38,641 --> 02:38:40,249
<i>People need hope.</i>

1813
02:38:41,570 --> 02:38:43,756
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1814
02:38:47,509 --> 02:38:49,159
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1815
02:38:50,066 --> 02:38:51,427
<i>scarred,</i>

1816
02:38:52,335 --> 02:38:53,572
<i>like me.</i>

1817
02:38:55,675 --> 02:38:57,738
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1818
02:38:59,098 --> 02:39:01,779
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1819
02:39:03,388 --> 02:39:05,120
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1820
02:39:06,604 --> 02:39:08,461
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1821
02:39:10,317 --> 02:39:12,213
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1822
02:39:13,162 --> 02:39:14,647
<i>to endure...</i>

1823
02:39:16,008 --> 02:39:18,112
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1824
02:39:20,998 --> 02:39:23,143
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

1825
02:39:23,226 --> 02:39:25,989
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

1826
02:39:26,072 --> 02:39:27,638
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1827
02:39:27,721 --> 02:39:29,329
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1828
02:39:29,412 --> 02:39:32,382
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

1829
02:39:32,464 --> 02:39:34,980
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1830
02:39:35,062 --> 02:39:37,478
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

1831
02:39:37,579 --> 02:39:40,013
Isn't that just terrible?

1832
02:39:41,374 --> 02:39:43,271
Him...

1833
02:39:43,353 --> 02:39:46,199
raining on your parade like that?

1834
02:39:51,849 --> 02:39:53,829
What is it they say?

1835
02:39:54,984 --> 02:39:57,129
"One day you're on top,

1836
02:39:58,655 --> 02:40:00,304
the next...

1837
02:40:01,666 --> 02:40:03,562
you're a clown."

1838
02:40:05,914 --> 02:40:07,069
Well,

1839
02:40:08,842 --> 02:40:11,646
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1840
02:40:13,914 --> 02:40:16,554
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1841
02:40:17,832 --> 02:40:19,648
You did so well.

1842
02:40:24,101 --> 02:40:25,091
And you know,

1843
02:40:26,741 --> 02:40:29,917
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1844
02:40:39,857 --> 02:40:41,217
Who are you?

1845
02:40:41,753 --> 02:40:44,145
Well, that's the question,

1846
02:40:45,383 --> 02:40:46,537
isn't it?

1847
02:40:49,425 --> 02:40:51,775
Riddle me this...

1848
02:40:54,209 --> 02:40:56,312
"The less of them you have,

1849
02:40:57,055 --> 02:41:00,849
the more one is worth."

1850
02:41:06,210 --> 02:41:07,943
A friend.

1851
02:41:33,885 --> 02:41:34,875
You're leaving.

1852
02:41:35,781 --> 02:41:36,854
Jesus.

1853
02:41:38,586 --> 02:41:40,153
Don't you ever just say hello?

1854
02:41:45,185 --> 02:41:46,588
Where will you go?

1855
02:41:48,072 --> 02:41:50,464
I don't know. Upstate.

1856
02:41:50,876 --> 02:41:52,568
Bludhaven, maybe.

1857
02:41:53,433 --> 02:41:54,423
Why?

1858
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:56,815
You asking me to stay?

1859
02:42:03,910 --> 02:42:06,014
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1860
02:42:06,426 --> 02:42:08,736
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1861
02:42:08,819 --> 02:42:10,716
There's gonna be a power grab.

1862
02:42:12,325 --> 02:42:13,438
It'll be bloody.

1863
02:42:14,056 --> 02:42:15,252
I know.

1864
02:42:16,778 --> 02:42:17,851
But the city can change.

1865
02:42:17,933 --> 02:42:19,170
It won't.

1866
02:42:20,284 --> 02:42:21,274
I have to try.

1867
02:42:21,357 --> 02:42:23,130
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1868
02:42:25,398 --> 02:42:26,511
Listen.

1869
02:42:28,903 --> 02:42:30,141
Why don't you come with me?

1870
02:42:31,090 --> 02:42:32,575
Get into some trouble.

1871
02:42:33,317 --> 02:42:36,782
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1872
02:42:37,441 --> 02:42:39,050
The bat and the cat.

1873
02:42:40,534 --> 02:42:42,185
It's got a nice ring.

1874
02:42:55,382 --> 02:42:56,784
Who am I kidding?

1875
02:42:58,228 --> 02:43:00,331
You're already spoken for.

1876
02:43:12,085 --> 02:43:13,487
You should go.

1877
02:43:21,861 --> 02:43:22,851
Selina...

1878
02:43:26,892 --> 02:43:28,543
Take care of yourself.
