00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:27,806
Hey!

3
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,472
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

4
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:04,472
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

5
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,098
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

6
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,514
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

7
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:12,430
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

8
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,014
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

9
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:17,556
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

10
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,681
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

11
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:23,514
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

12
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:26,348
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

13
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,889
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

14
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:32,140
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

15
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:35,014
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

16
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,472
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

17
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,472
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

18
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:39,806
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

19
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:40,931
<i>Under my administration,</i>

20
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:44,806
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

21
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,389
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

22
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:50,764
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

23
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:51,806
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

24
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,181
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

25
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:54,223
<i>But listen...</i>

26
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:55,722
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

27
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,265
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

28
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,764
Hey.

29
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:06,931
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

30
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,806
Why is she still tied?

31
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,389
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

32
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,889
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

33
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,848
Just call me in the morning, okay?

34
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,472
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

35
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:41,098
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

36
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,848
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

37
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:05,556
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

38
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,140
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

39
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:25,973
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

40
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:32,931
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

41
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,931
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

42
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:38,931
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

43
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,681
<i>Watching.</i>

44
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:47,681
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

45
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:55,848
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

46
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:11,306
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

47
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:14,098
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

48
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,681
<i>It's a big city.</i>

49
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,015
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

50
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:34,514
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

51
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,431
Look at this guy, man.

52
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:47,598
Boom!

53
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,931
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

54
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,514
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

55
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,015
Yo, let's see your hits.

56
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,222
That's you.

57
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:22,598
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

58
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:26,556
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

59
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,431
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

60
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:32,556
<i>It's a warning.</i>

61
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:35,347
<i>To them.</i>

62
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:46,264
<i>Fear...</i>

63
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:51,389
<i>is a tool.</i>

64
00:08:02,473 --> 00:08:05,639
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

65
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:20,014
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

66
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:23,973
Come on!

67
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:34,306
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

68
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:24,764
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

69
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,222
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

70
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,764
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

71
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:30,973
Help!

72
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:32,264
Somebody help me!

73
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:35,056
Help, help!

74
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,139
Where you goin', huh?

75
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:48,890
Come on.

76
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:50,639
Come on, man. Break it.

77
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:54,222
You can't move, huh?

78
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,306
Now knock his ass out.

79
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,097
Showtime. Showtime, man.

80
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,723
Come on, man.

81
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:01,055
Come on. Do it, man.

82
00:10:36,347 --> 00:10:37,973
You see this guy?

83
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:46,806
The hell are you supposed to be?

84
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:05,097
I'm vengeance.

85
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:08,139
Holy shit. It's him.

86
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:34,931
Hey, man. No, no, no!

87
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,014
Please don't hurt me.

88
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:55,598
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:58,389
Police action.

90
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,640
He's with me, Officer.

91
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,473
Are you kidding me, sir?

92
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:07,139
You're gonna let him in here?

93
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:10,598
Martinez, let him through.

94
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,972
Goddamn freak.

95
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:42,931
What do we know?

96
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,139
Detective?

97
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:56,847
Sorry, Lieutenant.

98
00:13:57,723 --> 00:14:02,223
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

99
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:06,139
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

100
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,931
All this blood is from his head?

101
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,389
No.

102
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,931
Excuse me.

103
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:22,097
Most of it's from his hand.

104
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:28,598
Thumb was severed.

105
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:32,431
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

106
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,723
He was alive when it was cut off.

107
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:37,431
Ecchymosis...

108
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,223
around the wound.

109
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,139
Security detail downstairs

110
00:14:57,223 --> 00:14:59,431
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

111
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:03,139
The mayor was up here alone.

112
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:08,264
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

113
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,431
You said there was a card.

114
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,097
Yeah.

115
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:31,264
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

116
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,264
Haven't a clue?

117
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:36,722
Let's play a game, just me and you.

118
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:40,306
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

119
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,722
There's a cipher too.

120
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:52,348
Any of this mean anything to you?

121
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,097
What's going on here?

122
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:00,598
I asked him to come, Pete.

123
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,348
This is a crime scene.

124
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:04,764
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

125
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,847
I got the press downstairs.

126
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:09,681
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

127
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:11,598
But this is way over the line.

128
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,348
Wait.

129
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,139
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

130
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,348
How do you know?

131
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:22,431
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

132
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,264
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

133
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:25,972
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

134
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,598
He lies still.

135
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:30,098
Excuse me?

136
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,722
The riddle.

137
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:36,722
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

138
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:47,348
Oh, Jesus.

139
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:53,390
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

140
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,223
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

141
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:58,639
Excuse me, Commissioner.

142
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:01,390
They're ready for your statement.

143
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:07,139
I want him outta here.

144
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:08,847
Now!

145
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:16,639
Come on.

146
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,639
Yeah.

147
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,306
The kid found him.

148
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,306
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

149
00:17:57,722 --> 00:17:59,889
We really gotta go, man.

150
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:09,181
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

151
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:11,473
A wife lost a husband.

152
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:14,223
And I lost a friend.

153
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,847
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

154
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,014
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

155
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:23,639
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

156
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,806
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

157
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:31,973
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

158
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:33,306
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

159
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,223
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

160
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:37,889
<i>but I don't know.</i>

161
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,681
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

162
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:48,847
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

163
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:50,931
<i>And now this.</i>

164
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,681
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

165
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,639
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

166
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,014
<i>But I have to try.</i>

167
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,056
<i>Push myself.</i>

168
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,597
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

169
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,472
<i>behind the mask.</i>

170
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:03,265
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

171
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:07,223
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

172
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:11,181
<i>everything that happened.</i>

173
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,306
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

174
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,265
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

175
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:34,181
<i>was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

176
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,014
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

177
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:37,764
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

178
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:39,348
<i>still have not been released,</i>

179
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,306
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

180
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,639
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

181
00:20:45,764 --> 00:20:47,556
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

182
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:50,181
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

183
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:54,514
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

184
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:56,348
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

185
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,390
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

186
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:01,306
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

187
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,223
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

188
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,098
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

189
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:09,848
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

190
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:13,181
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

191
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:17,223
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

192
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:21,472
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

193
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:22,973
I assume you heard about this.

194
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,098
Yeah.

195
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:34,430
Oh, I see.

196
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:37,181
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

197
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:38,931
Dear God.

198
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,722
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

199
00:21:57,722 --> 00:22:00,014
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

200
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:04,973
The killer left this for the Batman?

201
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,056
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

202
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Apparently.

203
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:11,306
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

204
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:14,681
Why is he writing to you?

205
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:16,181
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

206
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:17,306
I don't know yet.

207
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:18,931
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

208
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,223
Have a shower.

209
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:25,347
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

210
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,347
are coming for breakfast.

211
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:28,431
Here? Why?

212
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,597
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

213
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,764
I haven't got time for this.

214
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:32,514
It's getting serious, Bruce.

215
00:22:32,597 --> 00:22:35,681
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

216
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:37,347
I don't care about that.

217
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:39,140
Any of that.

218
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:40,723
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

219
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:46,223
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

220
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:48,472
If I can't change things here,

221
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:50,931
if I can't have an effect,

222
00:22:52,014 --> 00:22:53,639
then I don't care what happens to me.

223
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:54,848
That's what I'm afraid of.

224
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:56,556
Alfred, stop.

225
00:22:57,931 --> 00:22:59,389
You're not my father.

226
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,597
I'm well aware.

227
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:40,140
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

228
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:07,347
Some fresh berries there.

229
00:24:14,514 --> 00:24:15,639
What are you doing?

230
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:19,681
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

231
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:23,973
This is actually quite elusive.

232
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,639
Where'd you get those O's?

233
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:32,973
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

234
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,472
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

235
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:39,598
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

236
00:24:39,681 --> 00:24:41,056
see where it leads.

237
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:43,973
That's interesting.

238
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:46,347
Mr. Pennyworth?

239
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:47,723
Yes, Dory?

240
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:49,514
The accountants are here.

241
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,431
See them in, please, Dory.

242
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:56,556
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

243
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:58,222
What do you mean?

244
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:00,140
What if this is the whole key?

245
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:03,598
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

246
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,723
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

247
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:06,973
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

248
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:09,180
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

249
00:25:09,264 --> 00:25:11,098
I don't see how that's gonna...

250
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:14,639
Oh.

251
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:30,098
Damn.

252
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:32,514
Yeah, he's got a car.

253
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,806
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

254
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,556
Where to even start?

255
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,472
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

256
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:41,556
You don't trust me?

257
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:44,180
You mean like you trust me?

258
00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:47,139
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

259
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,264
There.

260
00:26:13,347 --> 00:26:14,639
What are we looking for?

261
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:16,806
A USB port.

262
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,015
USB?

263
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:26,264
What?

264
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,890
"Thumb" drive.

265
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:36,306
Jesus.

266
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,431
It's encrypted.

267
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:46,139
Try this.

268
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:55,514
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

269
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,973
Oh, well, well, well.

270
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,639
So much for family values.

271
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:10,973
Who is she?

272
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:12,639
No idea.

273
00:27:13,556 --> 00:27:16,389
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

274
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:18,222
I know who he is.

275
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:19,681
What was that?

276
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,264
Shit, shit! The drive.

277
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:27,347
It sent out the photos from my account.

278
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:29,973
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

279
00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:32,139
Jesus.

280
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:34,598
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

281
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,139
"He lies still."

282
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:37,389
About her?

283
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:40,222
Maybe.

284
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:42,264
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

285
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:45,765
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

286
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:47,973
Never get in there without a warrant.

287
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:51,389
Yeah.

288
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:05,681
Know who I am?

289
00:28:07,014 --> 00:28:09,264
Yeah. I got an idea.

290
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,139
I want to see the Penguin.

291
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:14,097
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

292
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:20,473
What's the problem?

293
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:21,972
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

294
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:24,222
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

295
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:25,931
That's what I tried to tell him.

296
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:28,306
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

297
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:30,264
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

298
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,723
Mine or yours?

299
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,014
Get him!

300
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,264
I saw that whole thing.

301
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:44,556
He's over there!

302
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,972
What is your problem?

303
00:29:28,598 --> 00:29:30,765
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

304
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:42,765
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:45,014
Take it easy, sweetheart.

306
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:46,889
You looking for me?

307
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:49,514
I see you met the twins.

308
00:29:50,473 --> 00:29:53,765
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

309
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,139
I guess we both are.

310
00:29:58,181 --> 00:29:59,598
How you doing?

311
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:01,640
I'm Oz.

312
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,431
Who is she?

313
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:13,389
I really don't know, chief.

314
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:16,306
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

315
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:17,765
but I wasn't rolling with them.

316
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:32,181
It's okay, baby.

317
00:30:32,723 --> 00:30:36,514
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

318
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:03,431
Thank you, honey.

319
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,765
Here you go, champ.

320
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:15,389
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

321
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,264
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

322
00:31:17,765 --> 00:31:19,139
Is that the mayor?

323
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:21,014
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

324
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,515
Don't make me hurt you.

325
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:27,765
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

326
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:30,805
Yeah, I do. Do you?

327
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:34,056
Look...

328
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:38,097
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

329
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:43,223
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

330
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:53,139
Tell you one thing.

331
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:58,889
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

332
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:01,889
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

333
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:06,972
What? Too soon?

334
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:19,181
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

335
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:29,473
Taxi!

336
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:32,972
Taxi!

337
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,014
Hey, it's me.

338
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,640
Baby, what's wrong?

339
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:58,306
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

340
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:02,181
On the news?

341
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:06,139
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

342
00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:07,931
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

343
00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:12,722
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

344
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:16,056
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

345
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:18,139
Uh...

346
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:21,680
God damn it.

347
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:43,639
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

348
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,598
<i>with a younger mystery woman.</i>

349
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,515
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

350
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:24,847
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

351
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:40,556
You're pretty good at that.

352
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:14,265
Hey! Give me that.

353
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:20,430
"Kosolov, Annika."

354
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:24,014
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

355
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:26,848
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

356
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:07,514
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

357
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:10,056
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

358
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,514
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

359
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,348
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

360
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,806
What does she know?

361
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:17,014
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

362
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:18,681
She did seem upset.

363
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:21,973
Back at your place.

364
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:25,514
Let's go talk to her.

365
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:52,764
Anni!

366
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:55,140
Baby!

367
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:57,806
Anni!

368
00:39:01,848 --> 00:39:03,098
Anni!

369
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:06,931
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

370
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,223
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

371
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,181
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

372
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:16,639
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

373
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:19,014
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>

374
00:39:19,098 --> 00:39:21,931
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

375
00:39:23,806 --> 00:39:25,556
Shit, they took my phone.

376
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,014

<i>inside the Police Athletic League

380
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:37,431
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>

381
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:40,389
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

382
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:48,181
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

383
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:50,223
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

384
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,347
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

385
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:58,223
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>

386
00:39:58,305 --> 00:40:00,347
<i>But I am not done.</i>

387
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:05,681
<i>Here is another...</i>

388
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:12,973
<i>who will soon be losing face.</i>

389
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:18,514
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

390
00:40:18,597 --> 00:40:20,431
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

391
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:25,514

392
00:40:26,306 --> 00:40:28,306

393
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:31,639
<i>Goodbye!</i>

394
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:37,514

<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

396
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:42,015
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

397
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:44,389
At the club.

398
00:40:46,056 --> 00:40:47,472
The Iceberg Lounge?

399
00:40:48,222 --> 00:40:49,681
44 Below.

400
00:40:51,597 --> 00:40:52,597
What is that?

401
00:40:55,848 --> 00:40:57,389
The club within the club.

402
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:00,389
The real club.

403
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:04,431
It's a mob hangout.

404
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:06,306
Is that where you work?

405
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:09,056
Selina?

406
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,806
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

407
00:41:20,264 --> 00:41:21,806
But I see 'em come in.

408
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:23,098
Who?

409
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,098
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

410
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:30,347
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

411
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:34,140
You're gonna help me on this.

412
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:36,264
For your friend.

413
00:41:46,848 --> 00:41:48,180
You got a lot of cats.

414
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,598
I have a thing about strays.

415
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,056
You're not safe here.

416
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,347
I can take care of myself.

417
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:02,222
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

418
00:42:02,306 --> 00:42:03,848
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

419
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:07,180
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

420
00:42:07,264 --> 00:42:10,098
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

421
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:31,264
He waited for him at the gym.

422
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:34,431
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

423
00:42:34,514 --> 00:42:36,639
when no one else was around.

424
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,181
There's a needle mark on his neck.

425
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:41,222
Injected him with arsenic.

426
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:44,556
Rat poison.

427
00:42:45,347 --> 00:42:46,931
Yeah.

428
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,556
That seems to be his theme here.

429
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:51,472
Look at this thing.

430
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:01,347
It's a maze.

431
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:07,222
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

432
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:11,056
More symbols.

433
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:15,139
It's another cipher.

434
00:43:15,222 --> 00:43:17,973
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

435
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,222
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

436
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:24,431
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

437
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:27,347
I don't get it.

438
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:29,806
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

439
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:32,723
Looks like he got greedy.

440
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:33,848
You kidding me?

441
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:36,639
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

442
00:43:36,723 --> 00:43:39,973
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

443
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:42,264
Maybe he's not who you thought.

444
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:45,848
You make it sound like he had it coming.

445
00:43:48,097 --> 00:43:49,556
He was a cop.

446
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,181
Crossed a line.

447
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:25,055
"I'm mad about you.

448
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:28,806
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

449
00:44:35,931 --> 00:44:39,014
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

450
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:42,765
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

451
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,556
The hell is that?

452
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:48,473
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

453
00:44:49,598 --> 00:44:51,097
I don't know.

454
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:53,139
Lieutenant.

455
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:54,639
They're coming back.

456
00:44:54,723 --> 00:44:55,972
We got to get out of here.

457
00:45:00,056 --> 00:45:01,264
Come on.

458
00:45:06,347 --> 00:45:07,389
Ow!

459
00:45:08,848 --> 00:45:10,181
I don't know about these things.

460
00:45:10,264 --> 00:45:13,723
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

461
00:45:17,723 --> 00:45:20,306
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

462
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:23,639
I'm just looking for Annika.

463
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,556
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

464
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:33,306
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

465
00:45:42,848 --> 00:45:44,056
Look at me.

466
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:55,848
Looks good. Here.

467
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:40,972
I got you. Can you hear me?

468
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:42,931
Yeah.

469
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:52,598
Hey, where you goin'?

470
00:46:53,222 --> 00:46:54,348
Hospitality.

471
00:46:55,097 --> 00:46:57,931
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

472
00:46:59,723 --> 00:47:01,222
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

473
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:09,972
"Kenzie, William."

474
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:11,514
He's an off-duty cop.

475
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:15,056
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

476
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:17,431
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

477
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:37,097
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

478
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:38,306
Great.

479
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:47,847
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

480
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,514
Feels good, doesn't it?

481
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:51,805
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

482
00:47:57,847 --> 00:47:59,473
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

483
00:47:59,556 --> 00:48:00,598
Really?

484
00:48:00,681 --> 00:48:01,640
'Cause when I first saw you,

485
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:02,931
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

486
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,264
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

487
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:07,640
Can we not do this right now?

488
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,097
Wait. Who was that?

489
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:12,348
Oh, I saw him.

490
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,515
<i>Look back.</i>

491
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:15,389
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

492
00:48:15,473 --> 00:48:16,805
I need to see his face.

493
00:48:18,473 --> 00:48:19,931
Jesus.

494
00:48:27,931 --> 00:48:29,097
That's the DA.

495
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:30,223
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

496
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:31,972
And he's coming over. You happy?

497
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:33,264
<i>Talk to him.</i>

498
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:37,473
Hey. How you doing?

499
00:48:37,556 --> 00:48:38,640
Hi.

500
00:48:38,723 --> 00:48:39,556
I'm Gil.

501
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:42,389
Hey, aren't you the DA?

502
00:48:42,473 --> 00:48:43,431
Yeah.

503
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,806
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

504
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,264
Is that right?

505
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:49,889
I haven't seen you around here before.

506
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,931
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

507
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,556
'cause people are all a little on edge.

508
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,139
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

509
00:48:57,223 --> 00:48:58,223
<i>Is that right?</i>

510
00:48:58,515 --> 00:48:59,722
<i>I like that.</i>

511
00:49:00,097 --> 00:49:01,139
Do you want to come over?

512
00:49:01,223 --> 00:49:02,348
Sure.

513
00:49:05,348 --> 00:49:06,681
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

514
00:49:06,764 --> 00:49:08,181
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

515
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:10,348
- <i>Richie, Glen.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

516
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:13,306
That's half the DA's office.

517
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:14,556
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

518
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,598
Hi.

519
00:49:15,681 --> 00:49:17,722
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

520
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:19,681
Drowning our sorrows.

521
00:49:20,014 --> 00:49:21,306
<i>You want a drop?</i>

522
00:49:21,389 --> 00:49:23,431
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

523
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:27,056
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

524
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:29,181
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

525
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,598
He's wasted.

526
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:31,722
No shit.

527
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:34,389
<i>I like this girl.</i>

528
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,431
Oh, hey, I like you too!

529
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:43,306
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

530
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,473
<i>He knows so much.</i>

531
00:49:44,556 --> 00:49:45,847
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

532
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:48,181
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

533
00:49:48,264 --> 00:49:49,181
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

534
00:49:49,264 --> 00:49:51,181
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

535
00:49:51,264 --> 00:49:53,223
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

536
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:57,056
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

537
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,598
<i>I mean...</i>

538
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:13,014
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

539
00:50:13,598 --> 00:50:16,014
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

540
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:17,806
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

541
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,473
He's talking about the Maroni case.

542
00:50:19,556 --> 00:50:22,847
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

543
00:50:23,431 --> 00:50:25,722
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

544
00:50:25,806 --> 00:50:27,722
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

545
00:50:27,806 --> 00:50:30,431
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

546
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:31,764
What do you know about that?

547
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,556
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

548
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:35,598
<i>I want a drink.</i>

549
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:37,014
Keep him talking.

550
00:50:40,098 --> 00:50:41,181
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

551
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:42,306
She knows Annika.

552
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:43,806
No, stay on the DA.

553
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:45,806
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

554
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:50,056
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

555
00:50:50,139 --> 00:50:51,181
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

556
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:53,806
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

557
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:55,139
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

558
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:57,681
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

559
00:50:57,764 --> 00:51:00,681
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

560
00:51:00,764 --> 00:51:02,264
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

561
00:51:02,348 --> 00:51:03,431
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

562
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:09,223
<i>Hey.</i>

563
00:51:09,806 --> 00:51:10,889
Hey.

564
00:51:12,056 --> 00:51:15,223
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

565
00:51:16,515 --> 00:51:17,722
How you been?

566
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:21,764
Yeah, I've been okay.

567
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:24,473
<i>I was just...</i>

568
00:51:26,515 --> 00:51:28,348
I was just headed back upstairs.

569
00:51:29,098 --> 00:51:30,098
Well...

570
00:51:31,181 --> 00:51:32,847
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

571
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:49,306
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

572
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,973
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

573
00:51:51,056 --> 00:51:52,847
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

574
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:54,764
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

575
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:55,931
Wait, what are you doing?

576
00:51:56,014 --> 00:51:58,431
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

577
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:04,014
Taxi!

578
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:08,973
Hey!

579
00:52:10,681 --> 00:52:11,764
I lost you in there.

580
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:12,931
Yeah, I gotta go.

581
00:52:13,806 --> 00:52:15,223
Oh, you need a ride?

582
00:52:15,931 --> 00:52:17,223
That's me right there.

583
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,390
Taxi!

584
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:25,597
I'm good.

585
00:52:27,306 --> 00:52:28,722
I hope, uh...

586
00:52:33,306 --> 00:52:34,722
I'll see you around.

587
00:54:01,306 --> 00:54:05,098
Just hold still.

588
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:04,306
What do you know about

589
00:55:04,389 --> 00:55:06,681
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

590
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,472
Yeah, sure, there was.

591
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:14,014
That's the rat we're looking for.

592
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:16,806
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

593
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:20,389
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

594
00:55:20,472 --> 00:55:21,931
Where are you getting this?

595
00:55:22,014 --> 00:55:24,889
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

596
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:27,140
Gil's very nervous.

597
00:55:28,098 --> 00:55:30,639
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

598
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:32,597
I worked that case.

599
00:55:32,681 --> 00:55:34,639
Riddler's not after you.

600
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:35,639
How do you know?

601
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:37,431
You're not corrupt.

602
00:55:38,472 --> 00:55:40,014
Colson's dirty?

603
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:47,389
Maybe I, uh...

604
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:51,389
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

605
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:54,764
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

606
00:55:55,514 --> 00:55:57,305
Who knows how many people it touches.

607
00:55:57,389 --> 00:56:00,597
Politicians. Police. The courts.

608
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:03,597
It could tear the whole city apart.

609
00:56:04,014 --> 00:56:06,056
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

610
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:09,431
And Riddler's the match.

611
00:56:10,305 --> 00:56:11,472
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

612
00:56:11,556 --> 00:56:12,848
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

613
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:14,347
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

614
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:15,931
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

615
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,556
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

616
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:20,305
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

617
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:22,889
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

618
00:56:22,973 --> 00:56:24,015
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

619
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:25,723
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

620
00:56:25,806 --> 00:56:27,639
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

621
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:28,973
Pretty.

622
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:32,347
She a new friend of yours?

623
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:38,140
I'm not so sure.

624
00:56:38,973 --> 00:56:40,472
Looks like you upset her.

625
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,764
Shall I take this as a good sign?

626
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:44,848
What?

627
00:56:44,931 --> 00:56:45,848
Your attire.

628
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:48,056
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

629
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,140
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

630
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:52,889
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

631
00:56:53,931 --> 00:56:55,514
Riddler might not be able to resist.

632
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:57,056
Oh, that reminds me.

633
00:56:58,223 --> 00:57:02,181
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

634
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:04,223
The one from the rat maze.

635
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:07,723
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

636
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:09,931
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

637
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:13,264
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

638
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,306
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

639
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:16,597
"Rat with wings"?

640
00:57:16,681 --> 00:57:19,181
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

641
00:57:19,264 --> 00:57:20,514
Yeah.

642
00:57:21,973 --> 00:57:23,098
A stool pigeon.

643
00:57:23,347 --> 00:57:24,973
Where are your cufflinks?

644
00:57:25,056 --> 00:57:26,015
I couldn't find them.

645
00:57:27,472 --> 00:57:29,431
Well, you can't go out like that.

646
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:31,306
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

647
00:57:35,472 --> 00:57:38,264
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

648
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:42,181
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

649
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:44,973
Your father gave them to me.

650
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:53,848
No more lies! No more lies!

651
00:58:12,015 --> 00:58:14,973
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

652
00:58:27,514 --> 00:58:29,264
Is that Bruce Wayne?

653
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:31,973
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

654
00:58:41,056 --> 00:58:42,056
Hold it.

655
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:44,639
You good, fellas?

656
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:46,222
Good.

657
00:58:48,347 --> 00:58:49,431
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

658
00:59:07,222 --> 00:59:08,222
Sir?

659
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,848
Hey!

660
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:30,931
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

661
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,723
Hey, watch it, fellas.

662
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:36,472
You got the prince of the city there.

663
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:41,139
Some event, huh?

664
00:59:41,222 --> 00:59:44,181
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

665
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:46,723
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

666
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:48,431
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

667
00:59:48,514 --> 00:59:50,514
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

668
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:52,806
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

669
00:59:53,431 --> 00:59:54,890
Wow. Is that right?

670
00:59:54,973 --> 00:59:57,015
His father saved my life.

671
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:01,181
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

672
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:05,890
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

673
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:09,389
Operated right on the dining room table.

674
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:14,723
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

675
01:00:16,139 --> 01:00:18,139
I remember your face.

676
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:22,097
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

677
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:24,598
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

678
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:27,514
"Hippocratic oath."

679
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:31,264
That's good.

680
01:00:31,806 --> 01:00:32,973
Excuse me.

681
01:00:36,556 --> 01:00:37,389
Yes.

682
01:00:51,556 --> 01:00:52,639
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

683
01:00:52,723 --> 01:00:54,306
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

684
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:56,765
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

685
01:00:56,848 --> 01:00:58,639
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

686
01:00:58,723 --> 01:01:00,139
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

687
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:01,639
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

688
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:03,139
<i>consider a donation to</i>

689
01:01:03,222 --> 01:01:05,264
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

690
01:01:05,347 --> 01:01:07,598
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

691
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:08,890
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

692
01:01:09,264 --> 01:01:11,806
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

693
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:16,639
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

694
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:19,931
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

695
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:22,806
He got what he deserved.

696
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:25,723
Know what I mean?

697
01:01:27,014 --> 01:01:29,139
Hey, don't I know you?

698
01:01:29,222 --> 01:01:30,306
Bruce Wayne.

699
01:01:31,222 --> 01:01:33,181
Why haven't you called me back?

700
01:01:33,264 --> 01:01:34,264
I'm sorry?

701
01:01:34,556 --> 01:01:36,890
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

702
01:01:36,972 --> 01:01:38,181
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

703
01:01:38,264 --> 01:01:40,931
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

704
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:42,347
Will you walk with me?

705
01:01:47,514 --> 01:01:48,848
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:01:48,931 --> 01:01:50,139
Mr. Wayne.

707
01:01:50,848 --> 01:01:53,931
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

708
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:56,348
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

709
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:58,848
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

710
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:01,389
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

711
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:03,264
Thank you.

712
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:05,139
My God.

713
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:09,473
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

714
01:02:09,556 --> 01:02:11,181
I want to continue this.

715
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:16,264
Excuse me.

716
01:02:18,306 --> 01:02:20,181
I'm so sorry for your loss.

717
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:23,306
Thank you.

718
01:02:23,389 --> 01:02:25,139
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

719
01:02:26,473 --> 01:02:28,348
Gil Colson is missing.

720
01:02:28,431 --> 01:02:29,723
What?

721
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:32,097
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

722
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,222
Christ, not again.

723
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:35,389
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

724
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,723
You got people looking for him, Jim?

725
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,681
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

726
01:02:42,765 --> 01:02:43,681
What'd his wife say?

727
01:02:43,765 --> 01:02:44,972
She hadn't heard from him.

728
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:40,598
Get out of the car!

729
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:43,556
Get out of the car and show your hands!

730
01:03:44,972 --> 01:03:46,181
Get out!

731
01:03:56,681 --> 01:03:57,972
Get 'em up!

732
01:03:58,056 --> 01:03:59,806
Get out! Show 'em!

733
01:04:04,264 --> 01:04:05,847
Christ, it's Colson.

734
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:07,640
There's a bomb around his neck!

735
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:24,223
Let's clear this place out now!

736
01:04:24,306 --> 01:04:25,931
We've got to get this place cleared out!

737
01:05:00,139 --> 01:05:02,889
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

738
01:05:05,889 --> 01:05:07,306
We don't know if he's in on it.

739
01:05:10,431 --> 01:05:11,764
What's he looking at?

740
01:05:30,515 --> 01:05:31,847
Holy shit.

741
01:05:32,889 --> 01:05:34,556
Are you kidding me?

742
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,389
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

743
01:05:38,223 --> 01:05:40,681
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

744
01:05:56,431 --> 01:05:57,640
Please.

745
01:05:57,806 --> 01:06:00,556
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

746
01:06:00,972 --> 01:06:03,181
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

747
01:06:03,264 --> 01:06:04,264
I'm so sorry.

748
01:06:04,764 --> 01:06:06,431
Looks like a combination lock.

749
01:06:06,515 --> 01:06:07,972
Can't we just cut it off?

750
01:06:08,722 --> 01:06:10,389
Not if you want to keep your head.

751
01:06:47,056 --> 01:06:48,306
<i>You came.</i>

752
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,223
Who are you?

753
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:52,764
<i>Me?</i>

754
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:56,764
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

755
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,639
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

756
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:05,014
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

757
01:07:05,556 --> 01:07:06,639
"Unmask"?

758
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:07,889
<i>Yes.</i>

759
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:11,556
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

760
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:14,056
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

761
01:07:14,722 --> 01:07:17,056
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

762
01:07:17,139 --> 01:07:18,931
How am I a part of this?

763
01:07:19,014 --> 01:07:20,931
<i>You'll see.</i>

764
01:07:21,014 --> 01:07:22,764
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

765
01:07:22,847 --> 01:07:24,931
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

766
01:07:25,014 --> 01:07:26,264
<i>We're live.</i>

767
01:07:26,348 --> 01:07:29,348
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

768
01:07:30,556 --> 01:07:31,722
<i>At the moment,</i>

769
01:07:31,806 --> 01:07:35,181
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

770
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,306
<i>is dead.</i>

771
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,390
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

772
01:07:38,473 --> 01:07:39,431
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

773
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:42,639
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

774
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:45,722
<i>You hear me?</i>

775
01:07:45,806 --> 01:07:46,806
Okay.

776
01:07:55,556 --> 01:07:57,639
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

777
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:01,556
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

778
01:08:03,597 --> 01:08:04,639
<i>Now,</i>

779
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:08,431
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

780
01:08:08,515 --> 01:08:12,098
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

781
01:08:12,681 --> 01:08:15,098
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

782
01:08:15,181 --> 01:08:18,515
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

783
01:08:18,597 --> 01:08:23,806
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

784
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:26,139
You want me to do puzzles?

785
01:08:26,223 --> 01:08:28,973
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

786
01:08:29,056 --> 01:08:33,139
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

787
01:08:33,223 --> 01:08:35,555
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

788
01:08:35,639 --> 01:08:37,806
Okay, okay. So I just...

789
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:38,973
You want me to...

790
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:41,431
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

791
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:45,139
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

792
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:49,889
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

793
01:08:49,973 --> 01:08:52,390
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

794
01:08:52,473 --> 01:08:53,555
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

795
01:08:53,639 --> 01:08:55,056
- "Justice."
- Huh?

796
01:08:55,139 --> 01:08:56,181
The answer's "justice."

797
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,473
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

798
01:08:57,555 --> 01:08:59,139
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

799
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:03,555
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

800
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,014
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

801
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,473
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

802
01:09:08,555 --> 01:09:09,764
Of course, of course. Of course.

803
01:09:09,847 --> 01:09:12,223
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

804
01:09:12,306 --> 01:09:16,431
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

805
01:09:16,514 --> 01:09:20,681
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

806
01:09:20,764 --> 01:09:22,555
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

807
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:23,889
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

808
01:09:23,973 --> 01:09:26,139
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

809
01:09:27,555 --> 01:09:28,681
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

810
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:30,014
- How much?
- Nothing!

811
01:09:30,098 --> 01:09:32,306
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

812
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:34,681
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

813
01:09:34,764 --> 01:09:35,597
What cases?

814
01:09:35,681 --> 01:09:36,806
He didn't ask me that!

815
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:37,889
Come on! Ten grand.

816
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:41,306
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

817
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:44,014
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

818
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:47,931
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

819
01:09:48,014 --> 01:09:50,431
<i>Last riddle.</i>

820
01:09:50,514 --> 01:09:54,847
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

821
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:59,223
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

822
01:09:59,306 --> 01:10:01,390
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

823
01:10:01,472 --> 01:10:04,014
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

824
01:10:04,098 --> 01:10:05,889
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

825
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:07,181
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

826
01:10:07,265 --> 01:10:08,931
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

827
01:10:09,014 --> 01:10:10,973
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

828
01:10:11,056 --> 01:10:12,597
If I go out this way, it's just me.

829
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:15,806
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

830
01:10:15,889 --> 01:10:17,348
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

831
01:10:17,431 --> 01:10:18,764
- People are watching.
- What people?

832
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:20,973
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

833
01:10:21,056 --> 01:10:23,223
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

834
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:24,181
<i>Four!</i>

835
01:10:24,265 --> 01:10:25,639
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

836
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,597
<i>Goodbye!</i>

837
01:10:57,764 --> 01:10:59,140
Who do you think he is under there?

838
01:10:59,223 --> 01:11:00,056
Take it easy.

839
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,140
I want to see.

840
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:03,681
What is that thing? Leather?

841
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,889
What's he got on his eyes?

842
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,430
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

843
01:11:10,514 --> 01:11:11,722
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

844
01:11:11,806 --> 01:11:12,973
Hey!

845
01:11:13,556 --> 01:11:16,681
Hey! Hey! Hey!

846
01:11:16,764 --> 01:11:18,430
Relax, God damn it!

847
01:11:18,514 --> 01:11:20,014
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

848
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:23,973
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

849
01:11:24,056 --> 01:11:26,472
Colson's blood is on his hands.

850
01:11:26,556 --> 01:11:27,973
Maybe it's on yours.

851
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,472
What'd you say?

852
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:32,140
He would rather die than talk.

853
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,223
What was he afraid of?

854
01:11:34,973 --> 01:11:36,056
You?

855
01:11:43,181 --> 01:11:44,597
You son of a bitch.

856
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:48,181
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

857
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:49,973
You could be an accessory to murder.

858
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,056
Why are we playing games...

859
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:54,056
Get him! Come on!

860
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,140
Back off! Back off!

861
01:11:56,223 --> 01:11:58,514
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

862
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:00,681
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

863
01:12:00,764 --> 01:12:03,556
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

864
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:07,764
You too now?

865
01:12:07,848 --> 01:12:10,389
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

866
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:13,056
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

867
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,389
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

868
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:19,681
Okay, give him the room.

869
01:12:35,305 --> 01:12:36,597
Two minutes.

870
01:12:48,347 --> 01:12:49,931
You listen to me.

871
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:53,514
We gotta get you out of here.

872
01:12:55,181 --> 01:12:57,140
That would put a lot of heat on you.

873
01:12:57,223 --> 01:12:58,889
Well, you punched me in the face.

874
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,431
Take this key.

875
01:13:03,723 --> 01:13:07,098
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

876
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,848
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

877
01:13:10,848 --> 01:13:13,140
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

878
01:13:16,514 --> 01:13:18,889
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

879
01:13:22,305 --> 01:13:25,015
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

880
01:13:25,098 --> 01:13:28,015
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

881
01:13:28,931 --> 01:13:31,556
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

882
01:13:34,264 --> 01:13:36,223
Or he moonlights as a cop.

883
01:13:40,806 --> 01:13:42,306
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

884
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:43,889
Somebody stop him!

885
01:14:22,056 --> 01:14:23,598
- There he is!
- Freeze!

886
01:15:09,931 --> 01:15:11,848
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

887
01:15:12,389 --> 01:15:13,598
I did.

888
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:17,056
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

889
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:19,180
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

890
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,389
I only trust you.

891
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:22,806
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

892
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:26,264
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

893
01:15:27,015 --> 01:15:28,139
You think Penguin's the rat?

894
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:31,264
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

895
01:15:31,347 --> 01:15:33,306
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

896
01:15:33,389 --> 01:15:34,723
DA was a regular too.

897
01:15:34,806 --> 01:15:38,306
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

898
01:15:39,389 --> 01:15:40,598
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

899
01:15:40,681 --> 01:15:41,639
The what?

900
01:15:41,723 --> 01:15:43,180
Riddler's latest.

901
01:15:43,264 --> 01:15:44,973
The cipher in the maze.

902
01:15:45,056 --> 01:15:47,556
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

903
01:15:49,139 --> 01:15:50,764
A penguin's got wings too.

904
01:15:52,764 --> 01:15:54,723
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

905
01:15:54,806 --> 01:15:56,472
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

906
01:15:56,556 --> 01:15:59,764
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

907
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:03,015
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

908
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:07,472
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

909
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:09,723
There's Penguin.

910
01:16:09,806 --> 01:16:11,681
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

911
01:16:13,306 --> 01:16:14,556
<i>You want to move in?</i>

912
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:17,890
<i>Let's follow.</i>

913
01:16:36,389 --> 01:16:39,931
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

914
01:16:40,055 --> 01:16:41,306
<i>I'm here.</i>

915
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,389
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

916
01:16:44,473 --> 01:16:46,973
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

917
01:17:06,181 --> 01:17:08,723
It's a drug lab. Drops.

918
01:17:08,806 --> 01:17:10,015
This is a buy.

919
01:17:10,097 --> 01:17:13,264
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

920
01:17:13,347 --> 01:17:14,514
Or they never shut it down at all.

921
01:17:14,598 --> 01:17:15,473
<i>What are you saying?</i>

922
01:17:15,556 --> 01:17:18,681
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

923
01:17:43,014 --> 01:17:44,431
This just got complicated.

924
01:17:45,181 --> 01:17:46,347
What do you mean?

925
01:17:52,264 --> 01:17:53,723
Hey! What happened?

926
01:17:53,806 --> 01:17:55,139
You all right?

927
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,639
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

928
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:09,389
Jesus.

929
01:18:10,139 --> 01:18:11,972
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

930
01:18:12,473 --> 01:18:13,806
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

931
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,598
Is that why you work in the club?

932
01:18:16,347 --> 01:18:17,389
It was all just a score?

933
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:21,264
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

934
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:24,556
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

935
01:18:35,848 --> 01:18:36,806
Jesus!

936
01:19:05,389 --> 01:19:06,514
Hey, Vengeance!

937
01:19:08,681 --> 01:19:11,389
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

938
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:53,848
Kenzie! Get the money!

939
01:19:59,264 --> 01:20:00,514
Hey! What the...

940
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:52,431
Whoa!

941
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,223
Come on! Come on!

942
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:01,723
This guy's crazy!

943
01:21:03,473 --> 01:21:05,181
Come on! Hey!

944
01:21:54,598 --> 01:21:55,598
Move!

945
01:23:00,348 --> 01:23:02,223
Get out of the way!

946
01:23:13,348 --> 01:23:14,431
Come on!

947
01:23:23,139 --> 01:23:24,264
Get out of the way!

948
01:24:01,473 --> 01:24:03,515
I got you!

949
01:24:04,764 --> 01:24:06,098
I got you!

950
01:24:06,181 --> 01:24:08,515
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

951
01:24:08,598 --> 01:24:10,056
I got you!

952
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:59,390
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

953
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:02,098
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

954
01:26:02,181 --> 01:26:03,473
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

955
01:26:03,556 --> 01:26:04,972
Cops caught you doing something.

956
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,680
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

957
01:26:06,764 --> 01:26:08,639
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

958
01:26:08,722 --> 01:26:10,847
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

959
01:26:10,931 --> 01:26:12,139
His drops operation.

960
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:14,680
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

961
01:26:14,764 --> 01:26:18,390
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

962
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,223
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

963
01:26:20,306 --> 01:26:22,639
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

964
01:26:22,722 --> 01:26:25,931
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

965
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,181
What are you, crazy?

966
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:28,348
That why you killed the girl?

967
01:26:28,431 --> 01:26:29,390
I didn't kill no girl!

968
01:26:29,473 --> 01:26:31,264
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

969
01:26:31,348 --> 01:26:32,639
But she got too close, right?

970
01:26:32,722 --> 01:26:34,931
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

971
01:26:35,014 --> 01:26:36,972
But somehow Riddler found out too.

972
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,972
He knows so much about you.

973
01:26:39,056 --> 01:26:41,098
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

974
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:43,889
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

975
01:26:44,306 --> 01:26:45,473
Why don't you start harmonizing?

976
01:26:45,806 --> 01:26:48,473
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

977
01:26:48,556 --> 01:26:49,889
I ain't no rat!

978
01:26:49,972 --> 01:26:51,806
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

979
01:26:51,889 --> 01:26:52,972
if he heard this kind of talk?

980
01:26:53,056 --> 01:26:55,223
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

981
01:26:55,306 --> 01:26:57,847
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

982
01:26:57,931 --> 01:26:59,473
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

983
01:26:59,556 --> 01:27:01,181
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

984
01:27:01,264 --> 01:27:03,181
Open your eyes!

985
01:27:07,098 --> 01:27:08,681
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

986
01:27:08,764 --> 01:27:10,264
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

987
01:27:10,348 --> 01:27:12,181
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

988
01:27:12,264 --> 01:27:14,597
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

989
01:27:14,681 --> 01:27:17,264
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

990
01:27:17,348 --> 01:27:18,722
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

991
01:27:18,806 --> 01:27:20,014
Why, you got something to tell us?

992
01:27:20,098 --> 01:27:20,973
Yeah!

993
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:22,681
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

994
01:27:22,764 --> 01:27:23,597
What?

995
01:27:24,014 --> 01:27:25,348
It's <i>"La."</i>

996
01:27:25,431 --> 01:27:26,722
<i>"La" rata.</i>

997
01:27:27,223 --> 01:27:29,223
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

998
01:27:29,306 --> 01:27:31,181
Jesus! Look at you two.

999
01:27:31,597 --> 01:27:33,847
World's greatest detectives!

1000
01:27:34,264 --> 01:27:36,555
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

1001
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:37,722
Jesus!

1002
01:27:37,806 --> 01:27:39,306
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

1003
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:41,390
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1004
01:27:42,806 --> 01:27:43,889
You think he made a mistake?

1005
01:27:43,973 --> 01:27:45,181
He doesn't make mistakes.

1006
01:27:45,264 --> 01:27:46,306
A rat with wings?

1007
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:47,973
You know what that sounds like to me?

1008
01:27:48,056 --> 01:27:51,223
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1009
01:27:51,306 --> 01:27:53,306
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1010
01:27:58,931 --> 01:28:02,806
"You are <i>el."</i>

1011
01:28:11,473 --> 01:28:12,973
Maybe it was a mistake.

1012
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:14,223
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1013
01:28:14,306 --> 01:28:15,139
Wait.

1014
01:28:18,555 --> 01:28:19,889
Is that him?

1015
01:28:20,764 --> 01:28:22,597
Holy shit.

1016
01:28:42,473 --> 01:28:44,056
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1017
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:17,056
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1018
01:29:17,139 --> 01:29:19,973
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1019
01:29:20,056 --> 01:29:21,973
I'll never know where I come from.

1020
01:29:22,847 --> 01:29:24,181
Do you know what I am?"

1021
01:29:24,265 --> 01:29:25,265
Any idea?

1022
01:29:25,806 --> 01:29:26,806
Yeah.

1023
01:29:28,223 --> 01:29:29,472
It's an orphan.

1024
01:29:38,348 --> 01:29:40,098
A mansion in a slum.

1025
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:44,223
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1026
01:29:44,306 --> 01:29:46,014
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1027
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:48,223
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1028
01:29:48,306 --> 01:29:49,139
Let's go.

1029
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:54,848
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1030
01:29:55,889 --> 01:29:57,265
You gonna untie me?

1031
01:29:57,348 --> 01:29:58,806
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1032
01:30:02,722 --> 01:30:03,722
Hey!

1033
01:30:05,181 --> 01:30:07,597
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1034
01:30:21,681 --> 01:30:23,848
No guns.

1035
01:30:25,306 --> 01:30:27,348
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1036
01:30:45,255 --> 01:30:45,372
What's that?

1037
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,556
Hey! Hey!

1038
01:30:55,014 --> 01:30:56,222
Dropheads.

1039
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,264
What the hell is that?

1040
01:31:17,014 --> 01:31:19,389
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1041
01:31:19,473 --> 01:31:20,765
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1042
01:31:23,514 --> 01:31:25,556
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

1043
01:31:25,972 --> 01:31:27,556
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1044
01:31:29,306 --> 01:31:30,889
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1045
01:31:32,181 --> 01:31:33,972
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1046
01:31:35,181 --> 01:31:38,640
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

1047
01:31:39,181 --> 01:31:40,972
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1048
01:31:41,056 --> 01:31:43,889
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

1049
01:31:43,972 --> 01:31:47,306
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1050
01:31:47,847 --> 01:31:49,723
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1051
01:31:49,805 --> 01:31:52,598
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

1052
01:31:53,056 --> 01:31:55,889
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

1053
01:31:56,473 --> 01:32:00,515
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

1054
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:02,515
<i>who need it now,</i>

1055
01:32:02,598 --> 01:32:04,056
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1056
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:05,556
"Sins of the father."

1057
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,097
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

1058
01:32:10,556 --> 01:32:12,640
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1059
01:32:16,515 --> 01:32:18,723
Shall be visited upon the son.

1060
01:32:20,723 --> 01:32:23,847
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1061
01:32:28,431 --> 01:32:29,847
Hey!

1062
01:33:29,473 --> 01:33:32,014
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1063
01:33:32,098 --> 01:33:33,931
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

1064
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:35,640
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1065
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:38,389
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1066
01:33:50,181 --> 01:33:51,931
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1067
01:33:53,098 --> 01:33:54,764
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:33:56,223 --> 01:33:57,972
I've been trying to reach you.

1069
01:34:00,722 --> 01:34:02,389
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1070
01:34:02,931 --> 01:34:06,680
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1071
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:31,014
We've sedated him.

1072
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:32,722
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1073
01:34:33,598 --> 01:34:36,306
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1074
01:34:36,847 --> 01:34:38,598
Is there anyone else to notify?

1075
01:34:39,931 --> 01:34:41,348
Next of kin?

1076
01:34:46,473 --> 01:34:47,556
No.

1077
01:34:48,681 --> 01:34:50,306
It's just me.

1078
01:36:33,306 --> 01:36:34,555
Selina?

1079
01:36:41,181 --> 01:36:42,181
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1080
01:36:45,306 --> 01:36:47,722
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1081
01:36:48,597 --> 01:36:49,681
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1082
01:37:08,348 --> 01:37:10,265
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1083
01:37:11,348 --> 01:37:13,806
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1084
01:37:13,889 --> 01:37:16,348
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1085
01:37:17,014 --> 01:37:18,764
How could they do that to her?

1086
01:37:18,847 --> 01:37:20,806
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1087
01:37:20,889 --> 01:37:22,806
Her body was in his car.

1088
01:37:22,889 --> 01:37:25,764
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1089
01:37:25,847 --> 01:37:28,847
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1090
01:37:28,931 --> 01:37:30,472
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1091
01:37:30,556 --> 01:37:32,181
She didn't know any better.

1092
01:37:32,265 --> 01:37:33,597
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1093
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,223
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1094
01:37:35,306 --> 01:37:36,806
It means your choices have consequences.

1095
01:37:36,889 --> 01:37:39,265
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1096
01:37:39,348 --> 01:37:42,056
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1097
01:37:42,139 --> 01:37:43,973
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1098
01:37:44,306 --> 01:37:46,472
Compromising yourself for money?

1099
01:37:47,848 --> 01:37:50,098
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1100
01:37:51,722 --> 01:37:55,390
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1101
01:37:55,472 --> 01:37:56,806
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1102
01:37:56,889 --> 01:37:58,223
Falcone owes me that money.

1103
01:37:58,306 --> 01:38:00,056
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1104
01:38:00,139 --> 01:38:00,973
Oh, really? Why's that?

1105
01:38:01,056 --> 01:38:01,973
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1106
01:38:02,056 --> 01:38:03,806
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1107
01:38:03,889 --> 01:38:04,889
would owe you anything.

1108
01:38:04,973 --> 01:38:07,306
Because he's my father!

1109
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:19,223
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1110
01:38:20,722 --> 01:38:22,014
Just like Anni.

1111
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:26,722
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1112
01:38:28,806 --> 01:38:30,140
To the club?

1113
01:38:31,056 --> 01:38:32,056
Yeah.

1114
01:38:34,764 --> 01:38:37,639
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1115
01:38:38,098 --> 01:38:39,848
Used to see him there.

1116
01:38:40,597 --> 01:38:42,597
He scared the shit out of me.

1117
01:38:44,556 --> 01:38:48,014
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1118
01:38:48,556 --> 01:38:52,389
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1119
01:38:55,764 --> 01:38:58,098
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1120
01:38:58,764 --> 01:39:00,265
Strangled.

1121
01:39:00,681 --> 01:39:04,140
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1122
01:39:06,014 --> 01:39:08,098
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1123
01:39:08,181 --> 01:39:10,347
and he didn't say a thing.

1124
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:13,973
Couldn't even look at me.

1125
01:39:17,722 --> 01:39:19,472
He owes me that money.

1126
01:39:21,265 --> 01:39:22,681
I'm sorry.

1127
01:39:23,806 --> 01:39:24,973
For what I said.

1128
01:39:26,347 --> 01:39:27,764
Oh, it's all right.

1129
01:39:31,306 --> 01:39:33,389
You assume the worst in people.

1130
01:39:34,306 --> 01:39:35,681
Which, well...

1131
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:39,889
maybe we're not so different after all.

1132
01:39:45,347 --> 01:39:47,098
Who are you under there?

1133
01:39:53,181 --> 01:39:55,056
What are you hiding?

1134
01:39:57,431 --> 01:39:59,265
Are you just...

1135
01:40:00,848 --> 01:40:02,556
hideously scarred?

1136
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:05,681
Yeah.

1137
01:40:12,931 --> 01:40:14,347
Listen to me.

1138
01:40:15,889 --> 01:40:18,764
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1139
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:24,597
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1140
01:40:25,223 --> 01:40:28,305
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1141
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:29,639
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1142
01:40:29,723 --> 01:40:30,973
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1143
01:40:31,056 --> 01:40:33,098
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1144
01:40:33,181 --> 01:40:34,431
I think you'd be on his side.

1145
01:40:34,514 --> 01:40:36,140
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1146
01:40:36,223 --> 01:40:38,181
What, do you live in a cave?

1147
01:40:38,264 --> 01:40:40,347
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1148
01:40:41,431 --> 01:40:45,305
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1149
01:40:45,389 --> 01:40:46,597
will you help me?

1150
01:40:47,848 --> 01:40:49,140
Please.

1151
01:40:51,931 --> 01:40:53,848
Come on, Vengeance.

1152
01:40:56,305 --> 01:40:58,556
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1153
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:00,264
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1154
01:41:09,806 --> 01:41:11,347
I told you, baby.

1155
01:41:13,264 --> 01:41:15,848
I can take care of myself.

1156
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,931
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

1157
01:41:37,764 --> 01:41:41,347
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1158
01:41:41,472 --> 01:41:43,306
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

1159
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:45,931
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

1160
01:41:46,098 --> 01:41:47,556
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1161
01:41:48,264 --> 01:41:50,598
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1162
01:41:51,806 --> 01:41:54,140
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1163
01:41:54,222 --> 01:41:56,681
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1164
01:41:56,764 --> 01:41:59,931
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1165
01:42:01,264 --> 01:42:05,931
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1166
01:42:06,015 --> 01:42:09,681
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1167
01:42:10,389 --> 01:42:11,931
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1168
01:42:12,015 --> 01:42:14,514
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1169
01:42:14,598 --> 01:42:16,222
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1170
01:42:16,306 --> 01:42:21,889
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

1171
01:42:21,973 --> 01:42:26,639
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

1172
01:42:26,723 --> 01:42:29,098
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1173
01:42:29,931 --> 01:42:32,431
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

1174
01:42:32,514 --> 01:42:36,431
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1175
01:42:36,556 --> 01:42:38,598
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1176
01:42:39,098 --> 01:42:43,389
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

1177
01:42:43,472 --> 01:42:46,056
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1178
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:49,222
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1179
01:42:49,806 --> 01:42:55,056
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1180
01:42:55,556 --> 01:42:57,931
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1181
01:42:58,015 --> 01:43:00,389
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1182
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:03,931
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1183
01:43:04,015 --> 01:43:06,806
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1184
01:43:08,347 --> 01:43:10,181
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1185
01:43:15,931 --> 01:43:17,015
Do you know who I am?

1186
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:19,764
You're Bruce Wayne.

1187
01:43:19,848 --> 01:43:21,723
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1188
01:43:32,472 --> 01:43:33,472
See?

1189
01:43:44,764 --> 01:43:47,389
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1190
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:50,264
Must have made a fortune.

1191
01:43:50,723 --> 01:43:52,473
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1192
01:43:53,973 --> 01:43:56,431
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1193
01:43:56,514 --> 01:43:57,514
No, boss.

1194
01:43:57,598 --> 01:43:59,931
$1,183.

1195
01:44:00,514 --> 01:44:02,473
You know why communism failed, right?

1196
01:44:02,556 --> 01:44:03,556
No, boss.

1197
01:44:05,473 --> 01:44:06,723
Austerity.

1198
01:44:08,973 --> 01:44:10,598
All right. All right.

1199
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:13,264
Look at that. Perfect.

1200
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:15,097
It's never gonna be that good again.

1201
01:44:17,306 --> 01:44:19,806
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1202
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:21,055
What are you doing here?

1203
01:44:22,973 --> 01:44:24,806
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1204
01:44:25,723 --> 01:44:26,764
Come on.

1205
01:44:28,681 --> 01:44:29,890
See ya, champ.

1206
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:32,139
Come on, sweetheart.

1207
01:44:34,097 --> 01:44:35,097
Have a seat.

1208
01:44:37,139 --> 01:44:38,931
I thought I might hear from you.

1209
01:44:40,097 --> 01:44:43,222
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1210
01:44:44,765 --> 01:44:46,556
stirring things up, huh?

1211
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,347
- Is it true?
- What?

1212
01:44:49,639 --> 01:44:51,264
That reporter business?

1213
01:44:52,598 --> 01:44:53,806
What do you want to know here, kid?

1214
01:44:53,890 --> 01:44:56,681
Did you kill him? For my father?

1215
01:44:56,765 --> 01:44:59,514
Look, your father was in trouble.

1216
01:45:00,389 --> 01:45:02,181
This reporter had some dirt.

1217
01:45:02,264 --> 01:45:03,890
Some very...

1218
01:45:05,055 --> 01:45:08,806
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1219
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:11,598
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1220
01:45:11,681 --> 01:45:13,139
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1221
01:45:13,222 --> 01:45:15,139
not right before the election.

1222
01:45:15,598 --> 01:45:17,890
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1223
01:45:17,973 --> 01:45:19,598
but he wasn't going for it.

1224
01:45:19,681 --> 01:45:22,848
So, he came to me.

1225
01:45:22,931 --> 01:45:25,306
Well, I never seen him like that.

1226
01:45:26,139 --> 01:45:27,972
He said, "Carmine,

1227
01:45:28,765 --> 01:45:33,473
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1228
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:38,806
And when fear isn't enough...

1229
01:45:39,473 --> 01:45:41,306
Oof. Hmm.

1230
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:45,972
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1231
01:45:46,972 --> 01:45:48,806
I handled it.

1232
01:45:50,514 --> 01:45:51,931
I know.

1233
01:45:52,014 --> 01:45:54,264
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1234
01:45:55,514 --> 01:45:57,348
But you'd be surprised

1235
01:45:57,431 --> 01:45:59,806
what even a good man like him

1236
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:02,473
is capable of in the right situation.

1237
01:46:04,723 --> 01:46:06,181
Do me a favor.

1238
01:46:06,514 --> 01:46:08,556
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1239
01:46:09,264 --> 01:46:10,848
This reporter

1240
01:46:11,681 --> 01:46:13,264
was a lowlife.

1241
01:46:13,348 --> 01:46:14,806
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1242
01:46:16,431 --> 01:46:18,056
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1243
01:46:18,806 --> 01:46:22,056
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1244
01:46:23,473 --> 01:46:26,972
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1245
01:46:27,056 --> 01:46:29,389
that your father would be in my pocket,

1246
01:46:30,139 --> 01:46:31,139
forever.

1247
01:46:31,806 --> 01:46:33,848
He would have done anything

1248
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:36,097
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1249
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:37,514
You understand?

1250
01:46:38,723 --> 01:46:43,264
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1251
01:46:43,348 --> 01:46:45,389
Do I know it for a fact?

1252
01:46:47,806 --> 01:46:49,889
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1253
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,556
This is what you wanted, huh?

1254
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,056
This little conversation here?

1255
01:46:58,473 --> 01:47:00,640
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1256
01:47:03,264 --> 01:47:05,389
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1257
01:48:14,723 --> 01:48:16,014
You lied to me...

1258
01:48:18,847 --> 01:48:20,473
my whole life.

1259
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,681
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1260
01:48:30,765 --> 01:48:34,056
He told me what he did for my father.

1261
01:48:38,056 --> 01:48:39,556
About Salvatore Maroni.

1262
01:48:41,556 --> 01:48:44,264
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1263
01:48:44,348 --> 01:48:46,097
Had my father killed.

1264
01:48:48,556 --> 01:48:50,764
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1265
01:48:53,515 --> 01:48:58,056
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1266
01:48:58,139 --> 01:49:00,473
believing that he was a good man.

1267
01:49:00,556 --> 01:49:02,139
He was a good man.

1268
01:49:03,306 --> 01:49:05,014
You listen to me.

1269
01:49:05,097 --> 01:49:08,515
Your father was a good man.

1270
01:49:12,139 --> 01:49:14,056
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1271
01:49:14,139 --> 01:49:16,056
He had a man killed.

1272
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:17,223
Why?

1273
01:49:18,389 --> 01:49:21,640
To protect his family image?

1274
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:23,972
His political aspirations?

1275
01:49:24,056 --> 01:49:27,598
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1276
01:49:30,181 --> 01:49:31,722
He was protecting your mother.

1277
01:49:32,681 --> 01:49:36,223
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1278
01:49:36,306 --> 01:49:38,431
He cared about her,

1279
01:49:38,515 --> 01:49:39,806
and you,

1280
01:49:39,889 --> 01:49:42,806
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1281
01:49:42,889 --> 01:49:46,348
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1282
01:49:47,223 --> 01:49:50,556
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1283
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:53,764
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1284
01:49:53,847 --> 01:49:55,681
That's who Falcone is.

1285
01:49:57,931 --> 01:50:00,139
And that was your father's mistake.

1286
01:50:00,223 --> 01:50:02,264
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1287
01:50:02,348 --> 01:50:05,098
your father was distraught.

1288
01:50:05,972 --> 01:50:09,181
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1289
01:50:09,264 --> 01:50:11,431
that he would confess everything.

1290
01:50:12,931 --> 01:50:14,931
And that night,

1291
01:50:15,014 --> 01:50:18,931
your father and your mother were killed.

1292
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:26,181
It was Falcone?

1293
01:50:32,223 --> 01:50:34,348
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1294
01:50:39,056 --> 01:50:42,598
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1295
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:45,431
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1296
01:50:45,515 --> 01:50:50,722
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1297
01:50:52,473 --> 01:50:56,348
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1298
01:50:57,014 --> 01:50:58,806
I know you always blamed yourself.

1299
01:50:58,889 --> 01:51:01,431
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1300
01:51:03,598 --> 01:51:05,889
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1301
01:51:07,306 --> 01:51:09,680
but I didn't know how to help.

1302
01:51:09,764 --> 01:51:12,264
I could teach you how to fight,

1303
01:51:13,639 --> 01:51:16,306
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1304
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,223
You needed a father.

1305
01:51:20,181 --> 01:51:22,598
And all you had was me.

1306
01:51:24,972 --> 01:51:26,181
I'm sorry.

1307
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:29,847
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1308
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:37,722
God.

1309
01:51:40,764 --> 01:51:45,181
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1310
01:51:47,889 --> 01:51:50,014
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1311
01:51:56,431 --> 01:51:57,681
I mean,

1312
01:51:58,889 --> 01:52:01,014
I'm not afraid to die.

1313
01:52:02,764 --> 01:52:05,139
I realize now there's something

1314
01:52:06,264 --> 01:52:08,139
I haven't got past.

1315
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:10,806
This fear...

1316
01:52:13,264 --> 01:52:16,223
of ever going through any of that again.

1317
01:52:20,473 --> 01:52:22,681
Of losing somebody I care about.

1318
01:53:13,223 --> 01:53:14,181
Hey.

1319
01:53:14,265 --> 01:53:17,014
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1320
01:53:17,098 --> 01:53:19,014
I thought it was you.

1321
01:53:31,931 --> 01:53:33,473
- I found him!
- I see that.

1322
01:53:33,556 --> 01:53:35,056
He had my shit and my phone.

1323
01:53:35,139 --> 01:53:36,348
She left a message
the night they took her.

1324
01:53:36,431 --> 01:53:37,348
She called me...

1325
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:39,139
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1326
01:53:39,223 --> 01:53:40,514
She got my gun!

1327
01:53:41,847 --> 01:53:43,556
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1328
01:53:45,098 --> 01:53:47,639
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1329
01:53:52,223 --> 01:53:54,306
Here. Listen.

1330
01:53:56,265 --> 01:53:57,931
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1331
01:53:58,056 --> 01:54:00,223
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1332
01:54:00,306 --> 01:54:02,390
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1333
01:54:02,472 --> 01:54:03,806
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1334
01:54:03,889 --> 01:54:05,597
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1335
01:54:05,681 --> 01:54:06,722
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1336
01:54:06,806 --> 01:54:08,098
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1337
01:54:08,181 --> 01:54:10,848
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1338
01:54:12,722 --> 01:54:14,764
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1339
01:54:15,472 --> 01:54:18,014
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
<i>- No, nothing. He...</i>

1340
01:54:18,098 --> 01:54:21,014
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1341
01:54:21,098 --> 01:54:23,806
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1342
01:54:24,348 --> 01:54:26,348
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1343
01:54:27,056 --> 01:54:29,931
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1344
01:54:30,014 --> 01:54:32,722
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1345
01:54:32,806 --> 01:54:34,931
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1346
01:54:35,014 --> 01:54:38,139
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1347
01:54:38,973 --> 01:54:41,514
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1348
01:54:42,597 --> 01:54:43,931
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1349
01:54:44,722 --> 01:54:48,265
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1350
01:54:48,764 --> 01:54:49,973
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1351
01:54:50,056 --> 01:54:52,014
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1352
01:54:52,098 --> 01:54:53,390
<i>The deal.</i>

1353
01:54:53,472 --> 01:54:58,390
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1354
01:54:58,472 --> 01:55:01,181
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1355
01:55:01,265 --> 01:55:03,639
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1356
01:55:03,722 --> 01:55:04,848
<i>Right.</i>

1357
01:55:05,597 --> 01:55:06,973
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1358
01:55:07,931 --> 01:55:10,098
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1359
01:55:17,764 --> 01:55:19,098
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1360
01:55:19,181 --> 01:55:20,722
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1361
01:55:20,806 --> 01:55:23,848
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1362
01:55:33,056 --> 01:55:34,348
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1363
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:40,889
A falcon has wings too.

1364
01:55:41,223 --> 01:55:43,056
Falcone is the rat?

1365
01:55:54,014 --> 01:55:57,181
Falcone works for you guys?

1366
01:55:57,848 --> 01:56:00,389
The mayor? The DA?

1367
01:56:03,389 --> 01:56:04,472
No.

1368
01:56:07,556 --> 01:56:08,848
We work for him.

1369
01:56:09,848 --> 01:56:11,098
Everybody does.

1370
01:56:11,181 --> 01:56:12,181
How?

1371
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:13,848
Through Renewal.

1372
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,014
Renewal is everything.

1373
01:56:16,098 --> 01:56:17,431
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1374
01:56:18,014 --> 01:56:21,723
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1375
01:56:21,806 --> 01:56:25,389
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1376
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:28,848
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1377
01:56:28,931 --> 01:56:31,014
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1378
01:56:31,098 --> 01:56:32,806
Everybody got a piece.

1379
01:56:32,889 --> 01:56:34,723
But Falcone wanted more.

1380
01:56:36,514 --> 01:56:39,723
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1381
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:43,472
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1382
01:56:43,848 --> 01:56:46,556
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1383
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:49,098
then install them all as his puppets.

1384
01:56:49,181 --> 01:56:51,723
You think this goddamn election matters?

1385
01:56:53,347 --> 01:56:55,265
Falcone's the mayor.

1386
01:56:56,223 --> 01:56:58,723
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1387
01:56:58,806 --> 01:57:00,181
Come on, Vengeance.

1388
01:57:00,889 --> 01:57:02,723
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1389
01:57:03,431 --> 01:57:05,056
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1390
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:05,973
No!

1391
01:57:07,431 --> 01:57:08,639
We'll get him.

1392
01:57:09,305 --> 01:57:11,181
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1393
01:57:11,264 --> 01:57:12,389
He owns the city!

1394
01:57:12,472 --> 01:57:13,723
Cross that line...

1395
01:57:14,514 --> 01:57:15,806
you'll become just like him.

1396
01:57:16,514 --> 01:57:18,056
Listen to me.

1397
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:20,015
Don't throw your life away.

1398
01:57:26,556 --> 01:57:27,931
Don't worry, honey.

1399
01:57:31,015 --> 01:57:32,472
I got nine of 'em.

1400
01:57:32,597 --> 01:57:34,556
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1401
01:57:35,848 --> 01:57:37,140
Oh, God!

1402
01:57:46,431 --> 01:57:47,556
She won't get out of there alive.

1403
01:57:47,723 --> 01:57:50,306
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1404
01:57:50,389 --> 01:57:51,389
I have to stop her.

1405
01:57:51,556 --> 01:57:52,514
Don't you mean "we"?

1406
01:57:53,848 --> 01:57:55,389
I gotta do this my way.

1407
01:57:55,723 --> 01:57:56,723
And then what?

1408
01:57:57,597 --> 01:57:58,973
We do what Riddler said.

1409
01:57:59,806 --> 01:58:01,431
Bring the rat into the light.

1410
01:58:37,347 --> 01:58:39,389
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1411
01:58:39,472 --> 01:58:40,931
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1412
01:58:41,556 --> 01:58:42,889
Tell him it's about Annika.

1413
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:47,472
Hey!

1414
01:58:48,306 --> 01:58:49,723
Look who it is, huh?

1415
01:58:49,806 --> 01:58:52,222
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1416
01:58:52,306 --> 01:58:54,306
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1417
01:58:54,472 --> 01:58:55,931
Absolutely.

1418
01:58:57,681 --> 01:58:58,681
Alone?

1419
01:59:15,222 --> 01:59:16,306
Hey!

1420
01:59:26,848 --> 01:59:28,056
I'm just so worried.

1421
01:59:28,139 --> 01:59:29,764
I don't know where she is.

1422
01:59:31,514 --> 01:59:34,890
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1423
01:59:34,973 --> 01:59:38,389
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1424
01:59:39,890 --> 01:59:42,264
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1425
01:59:43,723 --> 01:59:44,848
I'm sorry.

1426
01:59:45,056 --> 01:59:46,139
It's okay.

1427
01:59:46,222 --> 01:59:48,347
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1428
01:59:48,514 --> 01:59:51,389
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1429
01:59:55,639 --> 01:59:56,556
Mr. Falcone?

1430
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:58,097
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1431
01:59:58,181 --> 02:00:01,097
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1432
02:00:03,472 --> 02:00:04,973
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1433
02:00:05,056 --> 02:00:06,472
I'll be right back.

1434
02:00:21,764 --> 02:00:22,848
Holy shit.

1435

<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

02:00:40,306 --> 02:00:41,806
<i>The deal.</i>

1443
02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:46,681
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1444
02:00:46,764 --> 02:00:49,681
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1445
02:00:49,764 --> 02:00:52,306
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1446
02:00:52,389 --> 02:00:53,389
<i>Right.</i>

1447
02:00:54,264 --> 02:00:55,473
<i>Hmm.</i>

1448
02:00:55,556 --> 02:00:56,764
<i>Okay.</i>

1449
02:01:04,015 --> 02:01:06,389
<i>Revelations of
Mr. Falcone's secret role</i>

1450
02:01:06,473 --> 02:01:07,723
<i>as a mafia informant...</i>

1451
02:01:08,306 --> 02:01:09,556
Hey, Dad.

1452
02:01:10,598 --> 02:01:11,598
What?

1453
02:01:12,055 --> 02:01:14,097
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1454
02:01:15,723 --> 02:01:17,181
You remember her?

1455
02:01:19,222 --> 02:01:20,264
Yeah.

1456
02:01:24,556 --> 02:01:25,639
Just put down the gun, honey.

1457
02:01:25,723 --> 02:01:26,806
This is for my mother.

1458
02:02:24,014 --> 02:02:25,181
I see him!

1459
02:03:09,181 --> 02:03:10,930
You don't think this hurts me?

1460
02:03:15,514 --> 02:03:17,806
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1461
02:03:34,181 --> 02:03:36,014
You made me do this.

1462
02:03:37,431 --> 02:03:39,222
Just like your mother.

1463
02:03:45,222 --> 02:03:46,556
He has to pay!

1464
02:03:50,473 --> 02:03:51,598
You don't have to pay with him.

1465
02:03:55,222 --> 02:03:56,723
You paid enough.

1466
02:04:31,264 --> 02:04:32,389
Jesus.

1467
02:04:32,473 --> 02:04:35,181
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1468
02:04:35,264 --> 02:04:38,348
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1469
02:04:38,431 --> 02:04:39,681
I'm gonna start crying,

1470
02:04:39,765 --> 02:04:42,264
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1471
02:04:42,348 --> 02:04:43,972
Let me tell you something.

1472
02:04:44,056 --> 02:04:45,765
Whatever I know,

1473
02:04:45,847 --> 02:04:47,723
whatever I've done,

1474
02:04:47,805 --> 02:04:52,139
it's all going with me to my grave.

1475
02:05:02,681 --> 02:05:04,640
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1476
02:05:06,264 --> 02:05:08,556
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1477
02:05:16,473 --> 02:05:18,805
I guess we don't all work for you.

1478
02:05:27,805 --> 02:05:29,348
You have the right to remain silent.

1479
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:33,681
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1480
02:05:33,764 --> 02:05:35,097
You have the right to an attorney.

1481
02:05:35,181 --> 02:05:36,348
If you cannot afford one,

1482
02:05:36,431 --> 02:05:38,223
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1483
02:05:38,306 --> 02:05:40,014
Do you understand these rights?

1484
02:05:41,515 --> 02:05:43,097
Do you understand?

1485
02:05:45,056 --> 02:05:46,139
Yeah.

1486
02:05:46,223 --> 02:05:48,306
I'll see you when I walk out.

1487
02:05:48,389 --> 02:05:49,389
With these rights in mind,

1488
02:05:49,473 --> 02:05:50,764
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1489
02:05:50,847 --> 02:05:52,097
Goddamn rat.

1490
02:05:54,056 --> 02:05:55,389
What'd you say?

1491
02:05:55,473 --> 02:05:57,223
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1492
02:05:58,348 --> 02:05:59,598
Probably be your last.

1493
02:05:59,847 --> 02:06:02,889
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1494
02:06:02,972 --> 02:06:04,056
Maybe I am.

1495
02:06:04,139 --> 02:06:05,348
Really, Oz?

1496
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:10,139
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1497
02:06:10,223 --> 02:06:11,306
I'll spray paint your ass!

1498
02:06:15,389 --> 02:06:16,473
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1499
02:06:16,931 --> 02:06:18,931
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1500
02:06:20,264 --> 02:06:21,722
Get your hands off of me!

1501
02:06:41,264 --> 02:06:43,264
"Bring him into the light.

1502
02:06:46,847 --> 02:06:48,806
And you'll find where I'm at."

1503
02:06:48,889 --> 02:06:49,972
There!

1504
02:06:50,056 --> 02:06:51,889
The shots came from up there!

1505
02:06:53,473 --> 02:06:54,473
It's Riddler.

1506
02:06:56,556 --> 02:06:57,722
Gage, on me.

1507
02:06:57,806 --> 02:07:00,515
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1508
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:15,847
He's gone.

1509
02:08:25,639 --> 02:08:27,597
He's been here this whole time.

1510
02:08:27,681 --> 02:08:30,014
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1511
02:08:30,098 --> 02:08:31,223
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1512
02:08:31,306 --> 02:08:33,972
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1513
02:08:34,056 --> 02:08:36,515
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1514
02:08:36,597 --> 02:08:39,515
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

1515
02:08:55,014 --> 02:08:57,098
Police! Hands up!

1516
02:09:00,139 --> 02:09:03,639
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1517
02:09:22,764 --> 02:09:24,681
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1518
02:09:27,639 --> 02:09:28,931
Stay still!

1519
02:09:29,014 --> 02:09:30,014
Now!

1520
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:00,431
Which one is you?

1521
02:10:00,514 --> 02:10:02,014
You tell me.

1522
02:10:02,847 --> 02:10:04,306
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1523
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:09,139
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1524
02:10:23,639 --> 02:10:26,556
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1525
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:29,223
<i>have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.</i>

1526
02:10:29,306 --> 02:10:31,889
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Reál's headquarters right now...</i>

1527
02:10:31,973 --> 02:10:33,014
Hey.

1528
02:10:57,431 --> 02:10:59,139
What are all these diaries?

1529
02:10:59,223 --> 02:11:01,639
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1530
02:11:01,722 --> 02:11:05,265
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1531
02:11:05,348 --> 02:11:06,889
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1532
02:11:06,973 --> 02:11:09,265
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1533
02:11:09,348 --> 02:11:11,181
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1534
02:11:11,265 --> 02:11:13,681
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1535
02:11:13,764 --> 02:11:15,514
What about chain of evidence?

1536
02:11:16,348 --> 02:11:17,556
You should see this.

1537
02:11:23,514 --> 02:11:25,014
He's wearing gloves.

1538
02:11:26,472 --> 02:11:28,722
"Friday, July 16th.

1539
02:11:28,806 --> 02:11:32,514
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1540
02:11:32,848 --> 02:11:35,889
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1541
02:11:35,973 --> 02:11:37,390
But then, today, I saw it.

1542
02:11:37,472 --> 02:11:41,597
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1543
02:11:42,931 --> 02:11:44,722
'Renewal.'

1544
02:11:44,806 --> 02:11:49,223
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1545
02:11:49,306 --> 02:11:52,430
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1546
02:11:52,514 --> 02:11:55,848
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1547
02:11:55,931 --> 02:11:58,389
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1548
02:11:58,472 --> 02:12:01,472
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1549
02:12:02,597 --> 02:12:04,430
"If you want people to understand,

1550
02:12:04,514 --> 02:12:06,348
really understand,

1551
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:08,722
you can't just give them the answers.

1552
02:12:08,806 --> 02:12:10,265
You have to confront them,

1553
02:12:10,348 --> 02:12:12,764
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1554
02:12:12,848 --> 02:12:15,014
just like they tortured me.

1555
02:12:15,098 --> 02:12:17,889
I know now what I must become."

1556
02:12:20,848 --> 02:12:22,181
Jesus.

1557
02:12:28,265 --> 02:12:30,223
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1558
02:12:30,764 --> 02:12:32,265
This one's not a rat.

1559
02:12:48,889 --> 02:12:50,014
What is that?

1560
02:13:21,597 --> 02:13:22,806
Some kind of pry tool?

1561
02:13:22,889 --> 02:13:24,265
Is it a chisel?

1562
02:13:24,347 --> 02:13:25,806
It's a murder weapon.

1563
02:13:25,889 --> 02:13:27,265
He killed Mitchell with it.

1564
02:13:27,931 --> 02:13:30,806
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1565
02:13:39,389 --> 02:13:41,389
"My confession"?

1566
02:13:41,472 --> 02:13:44,347
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1567
02:13:44,431 --> 02:13:45,806
This isn't over.

1568
02:13:45,889 --> 02:13:48,305
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1569
02:13:48,723 --> 02:13:50,931
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1570
02:13:59,015 --> 02:14:01,223
His final post was last night.

1571
02:14:01,305 --> 02:14:04,514
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1572
02:14:04,597 --> 02:14:07,597
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1573
02:14:07,723 --> 02:14:11,140
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1574
02:14:22,472 --> 02:14:25,015
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1575
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:28,347
"The Truth Unmasked."

1576
02:14:29,181 --> 02:14:30,806
I think I'm his last target.

1577
02:14:33,389 --> 02:14:34,472
You?

1578
02:14:34,848 --> 02:14:36,889
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1579
02:14:37,431 --> 02:14:38,806
What is?

1580
02:14:39,264 --> 02:14:40,681
The Batman.

1581
02:14:46,056 --> 02:14:47,222
Yeah?

1582
02:14:58,514 --> 02:14:59,723
Right.

1583
02:15:02,598 --> 02:15:06,556
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1584
02:15:14,015 --> 02:15:15,514
You're a good cop.

1585
02:15:40,098 --> 02:15:42,472
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1586
02:15:43,222 --> 02:15:45,056
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1587
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:46,681
"Want"?

1588
02:15:47,264 --> 02:15:50,890
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

1589
02:15:52,098 --> 02:15:53,431
<i>For this moment.</i>

1590
02:15:54,472 --> 02:15:57,472
I've been invisible my whole life.

1591
02:15:58,556 --> 02:16:01,180
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1592
02:16:02,723 --> 02:16:05,139
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1593
02:16:05,222 --> 02:16:07,056
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1594
02:16:17,431 --> 02:16:19,389
<i>Bruce...</i>

1595
02:16:22,264 --> 02:16:24,098
<i>Wayne.</i>

1596
02:16:26,472 --> 02:16:30,222
Bruce...

1597
02:16:31,639 --> 02:16:34,514
<i>Wayne.</i>

1598
02:16:45,764 --> 02:16:48,181
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1599
02:16:50,764 --> 02:16:54,139
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

1600
02:16:54,222 --> 02:16:56,598
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1601
02:16:59,056 --> 02:17:03,306
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

1602
02:17:03,848 --> 02:17:07,389
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1603
02:17:07,473 --> 02:17:11,139
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1604
02:17:11,723 --> 02:17:13,264
<i>Orphan.</i>

1605
02:17:18,931 --> 02:17:24,055
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

1606
02:17:25,347 --> 02:17:29,973
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

1607
02:17:30,639 --> 02:17:32,181
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1608
02:17:34,806 --> 02:17:37,473
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1609
02:17:37,848 --> 02:17:40,431
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1610
02:17:41,723 --> 02:17:45,765
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

1611
02:17:47,473 --> 02:17:52,139
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

1612
02:17:53,306 --> 02:17:56,473
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1613
02:17:56,556 --> 02:17:58,848
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1614
02:18:00,139 --> 02:18:02,723
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1615
02:18:05,639 --> 02:18:08,806
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

1616
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:11,806
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

1617
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:12,890
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1618
02:18:14,347 --> 02:18:16,389
<i>Bruce...</i>

1619
02:18:17,431 --> 02:18:19,347
<i>Wayne.</i>

1620
02:18:23,014 --> 02:18:26,097
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1621
02:18:29,514 --> 02:18:32,639
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1622
02:18:34,097 --> 02:18:37,972
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1623
02:18:41,139 --> 02:18:42,306
<i>God.</i>

1624
02:18:43,306 --> 02:18:44,598
<i>Look at you.</i>

1625
02:18:46,264 --> 02:18:48,723
Your mask is amazing.

1626
02:18:48,806 --> 02:18:51,723
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1627
02:18:51,806 --> 02:18:52,890
Ain't it funny?

1628
02:18:52,972 --> 02:18:57,389
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

1629
02:18:58,848 --> 02:19:00,890
<i>You and I both know</i>

1630
02:19:01,848 --> 02:19:04,347
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1631
02:19:04,431 --> 02:19:08,056
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1632
02:19:08,139 --> 02:19:09,681
<i>No shame,</i>

1633
02:19:10,598 --> 02:19:11,598
<i>no limits.</i>

1634
02:19:11,681 --> 02:19:13,348
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1635
02:19:14,222 --> 02:19:15,222
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1636
02:19:15,306 --> 02:19:17,014
<i>All those cards.</i>

1637
02:19:17,097 --> 02:19:18,306
<i>I told you,</i>

1638
02:19:19,014 --> 02:19:20,930
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

1639
02:19:21,014 --> 02:19:23,222
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1640
02:19:23,306 --> 02:19:24,765
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1641
02:19:24,848 --> 02:19:26,848
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

1642
02:19:26,930 --> 02:19:28,097
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1643
02:19:28,181 --> 02:19:29,181
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1644
02:19:29,264 --> 02:19:31,765
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1645
02:19:31,848 --> 02:19:34,264
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

1646
02:19:34,348 --> 02:19:37,514
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

1647
02:19:37,598 --> 02:19:39,222
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1648
02:19:39,306 --> 02:19:40,514
You gave me that.

1649
02:19:40,598 --> 02:19:41,723
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1650
02:19:41,806 --> 02:19:44,389
You showed me what was possible.

1651
02:19:44,473 --> 02:19:49,348
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

1652
02:19:49,431 --> 02:19:50,972
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1653
02:19:51,056 --> 02:19:52,556
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1654
02:19:53,681 --> 02:19:54,765
<i>What?</i>

1655
02:19:54,848 --> 02:19:57,014
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1656
02:19:57,097 --> 02:19:58,473
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1657
02:19:58,556 --> 02:20:00,056
You think you'll be remembered?

1658
02:20:00,139 --> 02:20:01,806
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1659
02:20:02,306 --> 02:20:04,056
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

1660
02:20:04,139 --> 02:20:05,806
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

1661
02:20:05,889 --> 02:20:06,930
<i>No, no!</i>

1662
02:20:07,014 --> 02:20:07,930
<i>A nobody!</i>

1663
02:20:09,723 --> 02:20:11,514
<i>No!</i>

1664
02:20:13,431 --> 02:20:15,806
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1665
02:20:16,056 --> 02:20:18,640
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

1666
02:20:19,598 --> 02:20:23,222
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1667
02:20:23,306 --> 02:20:25,930
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1668
02:20:26,930 --> 02:20:28,930
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1669
02:20:29,306 --> 02:20:32,598
We could watch the whole thing together.

1670
02:20:32,681 --> 02:20:33,681
<i>Watch what?</i>

1671
02:20:33,765 --> 02:20:35,514
<i>Everything!</i>

1672
02:20:43,847 --> 02:20:45,514
<i>It was all there.</i>

1673
02:20:47,681 --> 02:20:50,014
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1674
02:20:54,306 --> 02:20:58,222
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

1675
02:21:00,264 --> 02:21:02,348
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1676
02:21:02,806 --> 02:21:04,056
<i>What have you done?</i>

1677
02:21:04,765 --> 02:21:09,640
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1678
02:21:12,473 --> 02:21:14,306
<i>You.</i>

1679
02:21:15,972 --> 02:21:18,097
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

1680
02:21:19,431 --> 02:21:20,972
<i>What have you done?</i>

1681
02:21:22,514 --> 02:21:28,348
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1682
02:21:28,765 --> 02:21:30,640
<i>What have you done?</i>

1683
02:21:33,097 --> 02:21:34,473
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1684
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:36,056
<i>What have you done?</i>

1685
02:21:40,056 --> 02:21:43,431
<i>Maria</i>

1686
02:21:43,598 --> 02:21:49,139
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1687
02:22:20,972 --> 02:22:22,348
Hey!

1688
02:22:23,348 --> 02:22:24,640
What are you doing in here?

1689
02:22:42,556 --> 02:22:45,139
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1690
02:22:51,722 --> 02:22:54,181
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1691
02:22:55,056 --> 02:22:57,806
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1692
02:23:02,473 --> 02:23:05,515
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

1693
02:23:05,598 --> 02:23:07,764
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1694
02:23:07,847 --> 02:23:10,097
It's a tucker.

1695
02:23:27,889 --> 02:23:28,889
Huh.

1696
02:23:44,056 --> 02:23:46,847
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1697
02:23:46,931 --> 02:23:48,431
What are you doing?

1698
02:24:18,931 --> 02:24:20,348
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1699
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:22,889
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

1700

<i>and a special thanks to everyone

1701
02:24:26,014 --> 02:24:27,014
Detonators?

1702
02:24:27,098 --> 02:24:32,139
<i>I just want to say this will be my last

<i>She promised real change.</i>

<i>But we know the truth, don't we?</i>

1712
02:25:06,639 --> 02:25:08,722
<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

1713
02:25:08,806 --> 02:25:10,681
<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

1714
02:25:10,764 --> 02:25:13,722
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

1715
02:25:13,806 --> 02:25:17,639
<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

1716
02:25:17,722 --> 02:25:21,556
<i>But unmasking is not enough.</i>

1717

<i>The day of judgment is finally upon us.</i>

1718

<i>And now it is time</i>

1719
02:25:31,306 --> 02:25:33,681
<i>for retribution.</i>

1720
02:25:33,764 --> 02:25:36,555
<i>I've parked seven vans</i>

Boom!

1725
02:26:05,348 --> 02:26:06,806
Boom!

1726

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

1727
02:26:11,806 --> 02:26:17,431
<i>the flooding will happen so fast,
evacuation will not be an option.</i>

1728

<i>Those who are not washed away</i>

1729

Call Gordon.

02:26:25,056 --> 02:26:27,181
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

<i>As breaking news</i>

<i>We'll give them real, real change now.</i>

<i>We've spent our lives in this
wretched place, suffering!</i>

<i>Wondering, "Why us?"</i>

1748

<i>why them?</i>

02:27:45,514 --> 02:27:47,556

Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1752
02:27:55,931 --> 02:27:57,556
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

1753
02:27:57,639 --> 02:28:00,514
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1754
02:28:00,597 --> 02:28:02,556
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

1755
02:28:12,181 --> 02:28:13,848
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

1756
02:28:13,931 --> 02:28:15,430
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1757
02:28:15,514 --> 02:28:17,348
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1758
02:28:17,430 --> 02:28:18,681
We got an active situation.

1759
02:28:18,806 --> 02:28:20,098
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1760
02:28:20,181 --> 02:28:21,389
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

1761
02:28:21,472 --> 02:28:22,389
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

1762
02:28:22,472 --> 02:28:23,306
Come!

1763
02:28:59,306 --> 02:29:00,722
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

1764
02:29:00,806 --> 02:29:01,681
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1765
02:29:01,764 --> 02:29:03,140
The water's already started to breach.

1766
02:29:03,223 --> 02:29:04,764
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1767
02:29:04,848 --> 02:29:07,056
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1768
02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:08,973
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1769
02:29:09,056 --> 02:29:11,389
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1770
02:29:11,472 --> 02:29:13,722
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1771
02:29:13,806 --> 02:29:16,056
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1772
02:29:16,140 --> 02:29:17,973
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1773
02:29:18,056 --> 02:29:21,056
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1774
02:29:21,140 --> 02:29:22,639
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1775
02:29:27,806 --> 02:29:31,265
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1776
02:29:31,347 --> 02:29:33,639
Please! I just need your attention!

1777
02:29:49,514 --> 02:29:50,639
You're okay!

1778
02:31:21,472 --> 02:31:24,098
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1779
02:31:24,181 --> 02:31:25,389
Follow me, sir.

1780
02:33:35,264 --> 02:33:36,764
No, no. It's okay.

1781
02:33:36,848 --> 02:33:37,890
It's okay.

1782
02:33:39,056 --> 02:33:40,097
It's okay.

1783
02:33:41,723 --> 02:33:43,848
It's done now. It's done.

1784
02:33:46,556 --> 02:33:47,890
It's over.

1785
02:34:43,681 --> 02:34:47,139
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1786
02:34:47,848 --> 02:34:50,181
Take it easy. Easy.

1787
02:35:18,723 --> 02:35:19,848
Jesus.

1788
02:35:29,681 --> 02:35:31,347
Who the hell are you?

1789
02:35:35,556 --> 02:35:36,556
Me?

1790
02:35:39,723 --> 02:35:41,139
I'm Vengeance.

1791
02:39:13,389 --> 02:39:15,681
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1792
02:39:18,889 --> 02:39:20,764
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1793
02:39:23,097 --> 02:39:24,847
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1794
02:39:27,139 --> 02:39:29,139
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1795
02:39:30,056 --> 02:39:31,681
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1796
02:39:34,889 --> 02:39:38,598
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1797
02:39:38,681 --> 02:39:41,223
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>

1798
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:46,097
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1799
02:39:49,056 --> 02:39:52,181
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1800
02:39:53,556 --> 02:39:54,931
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1801
02:39:55,556 --> 02:39:57,014
But not just our city.

1802
02:39:57,722 --> 02:40:01,931
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1803
02:40:02,014 --> 02:40:04,098
in our elected officials,

1804
02:40:04,181 --> 02:40:05,473
in each other.

1805
02:40:06,264 --> 02:40:09,598
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1806
02:40:13,931 --> 02:40:15,598
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1807
02:40:17,056 --> 02:40:19,223
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1808
02:40:21,306 --> 02:40:23,223
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1809
02:40:25,598 --> 02:40:28,640
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1810
02:40:29,972 --> 02:40:32,348
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1811
02:40:34,764 --> 02:40:36,806
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1812
02:40:39,889 --> 02:40:41,515
<i>People need hope.</i>

1813
02:40:42,722 --> 02:40:44,931
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1814
02:40:48,722 --> 02:40:50,390
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1815
02:40:51,306 --> 02:40:52,680
<i>scarred,</i>

1816
02:40:53,598 --> 02:40:54,847
<i>like me.</i>

1817
02:40:56,972 --> 02:40:59,056
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1818
02:41:00,431 --> 02:41:03,139
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1819
02:41:04,764 --> 02:41:06,515
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1820
02:41:08,014 --> 02:41:09,889
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1821
02:41:11,764 --> 02:41:13,680
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1822
02:41:14,639 --> 02:41:16,139
<i>to endure...</i>

1823
02:41:17,515 --> 02:41:19,639
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1824
02:41:22,556 --> 02:41:24,722
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

1825
02:41:24,806 --> 02:41:27,598
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

1826
02:41:27,681 --> 02:41:29,264
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1827
02:41:29,348 --> 02:41:30,972
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1828
02:41:31,056 --> 02:41:34,056
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

1829
02:41:34,139 --> 02:41:36,681
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1830
02:41:36,764 --> 02:41:39,098
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

1831
02:41:39,181 --> 02:41:41,639
Isn't that just terrible?

1832
02:41:43,014 --> 02:41:44,931
Him...

1833
02:41:45,014 --> 02:41:47,889
raining on your parade like that?

1834
02:41:53,597 --> 02:41:55,597
What is it they say?

1835
02:41:56,764 --> 02:41:58,931
"One day you're on top,

1836
02:42:00,473 --> 02:42:02,139
the next...

1837
02:42:03,515 --> 02:42:05,431
you're a clown."

1838
02:42:07,806 --> 02:42:08,973
Well,

1839
02:42:10,764 --> 02:42:13,597
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1840
02:42:15,889 --> 02:42:18,555
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1841
02:42:19,847 --> 02:42:21,681
You did so well.

1842
02:42:26,181 --> 02:42:27,181
And you know,

1843
02:42:28,847 --> 02:42:32,056
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1844
02:42:42,098 --> 02:42:43,473
Who are you?

1845
02:42:44,014 --> 02:42:46,431
Well, that's the question,

1846
02:42:47,681 --> 02:42:48,847
isn't it?

1847
02:42:51,764 --> 02:42:54,139
Riddle me this...

1848
02:42:56,597 --> 02:42:58,722
"The less of them you have,

1849
02:42:59,473 --> 02:43:03,306
the more one is worth."

1850
02:43:08,722 --> 02:43:10,473
A friend.

1851
02:43:36,681 --> 02:43:37,681
You're leaving.

1852
02:43:38,597 --> 02:43:39,681
Jesus.

1853
02:43:41,431 --> 02:43:43,014
Don't you ever just say hello?

1854
02:43:48,098 --> 02:43:49,514
Where will you go?

1855
02:43:51,014 --> 02:43:53,431
I don't know. Upstate.

1856
02:43:53,847 --> 02:43:55,556
Bludhaven, maybe.

1857
02:43:56,431 --> 02:43:57,431
Why?

1858
02:43:58,639 --> 02:43:59,847
You asking me to stay?

1859
02:44:06,889 --> 02:44:09,014
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1860
02:44:09,431 --> 02:44:11,764
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1861
02:44:11,848 --> 02:44:13,764
There's gonna be a power grab.

1862
02:44:15,390 --> 02:44:16,514
It'll be bloody.

1863
02:44:17,139 --> 02:44:18,348
I know.

1864
02:44:19,889 --> 02:44:20,973
But the city can change.

1865
02:44:21,056 --> 02:44:22,306
It won't.

1866
02:44:23,430 --> 02:44:24,430
I have to try.

1867
02:44:24,514 --> 02:44:26,306
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1868
02:44:28,597 --> 02:44:29,722
Listen.

1869
02:44:32,139 --> 02:44:33,390
Why don't you come with me?

1870
02:44:34,348 --> 02:44:35,848
Get into some trouble.

1871
02:44:36,597 --> 02:44:40,098
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1872
02:44:40,764 --> 02:44:42,390
The bat and the cat.

1873
02:44:43,889 --> 02:44:45,556
It's got a nice ring.

1874
02:44:58,889 --> 02:45:00,306
Who am I kidding?

1875
02:45:01,764 --> 02:45:03,889
You're already spoken for.

1876
02:45:15,764 --> 02:45:17,181
You should go.

1877
02:45:25,514 --> 02:45:26,514
Selina...

1878
02:45:30,597 --> 02:45:32,265
Take care of yourself.

1879
02:47:31,648 --> 02:47:32,164
